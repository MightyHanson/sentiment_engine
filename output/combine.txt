Text Content: The number of workers looting their retirement savings is escalating.In the second quarter, the tally of folks taking hardship withdrawals from their 401(k) was up 12% compared to the first three months of the year and leapt 36% year over year, according to a new survey from Bank of America, which tracks about 4 million clients’ employee benefit programs.Borrowing from retirement savings was also up. The percentage of 401(k) participants who got a loan from their workplace plan stash in the second quarter was 2.5%, up from 1.9% in the first three months of the year.Read more: What is compound interest, and how is it calculated?Experts are worried that people are beginning to treat these accounts as savings rather than retirement accounts and may even be spurred to do more in the future due to a change in the law that could end up having the opposite effect than intended.“I fear the public will go in and out of their retirement plans,” Steve Parrish, adjunct professor and co-director of the Center for Retirement Income at The American College of Financial Services, told Yahoo Finance. “The current increase in withdrawals and loans may be an indicator of movements to come.”(Getty Creative)'Understand the consequences'According to the Bank of America survey, the average worker hardship withdrawal from a 401(k) plan in the second quarter of the year was $5,050, on par with the average withdrawal of $5,100 in the first quarter.The average loan per participant was $8,550. Generations with the highest percentage of loans outstanding are Gen X (22%) followed by millennials (14.5%).Withdrawals, of course, are worse for savers because not only is that money gone, robbing your future self, the withdrawal triggers some hefty taxes and penalties.A withdrawal from your 401(k) account is typically taxed as ordinary income. Also, you’ll pay a 10% early withdrawal penalty before age 59½, unless you meet one of the IRS exceptions. These include certain medical expenses, qualified tuition payments, and up to $10,000 for first-time homebuyers. Some employer plans, too, will allow a non-hardship withdrawal.Story continuesWith a loan, you borrow money from your retirement savings and pay it back to yourself, usually within five years, with interest — the loan payments and interest go back into your account.One caveat: If you leave your current job, you might have to repay your loan in full within short order. When you can't repay the loan, it's considered defaulted, and you'll owe both taxes and a 10% penalty if you're under 59 ½.“Yes, you can access your accounts, but you need to understand the consequences,” Parrish said.(Fidelity Investments)'Prioritizing short-term expenses over long-term saving'There are myriad reasons for pulling money from these accounts ranging from paying off high interest credit card debt — interest rates on credit cards are at near 40-year highs — to medical bills, home improvements, buying a car or a house, or plainly to make ends meet right now.“In 2023, the rise in living costs and short-term financial needs are forcing participants to dip into their retirement savings,” Lisa Margeson, managing director of external affairs, retirement research, and insights at Bank of America, told Yahoo Finance.The findings also match other recent data on retirement account raids.A 2023 survey by the nonprofit Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies (TCRS) in collaboration with the Transamerica Institute, published in July, reported that nearly 4 in 10 (37%) of workers have taken a loan, early withdrawal, and/or hardship withdrawal from their 401(k) or similar plan or IRA. That includes a hefty 28% of Gen Z workers who have taken a hardship withdrawal, 24% of millennials, 19% of Gen X, and 12% of boomers, according to the report.Last year, 2.8% of 401(k) plan participants took a hardship withdrawal, a record high, up from 2.1% in 2021 and 1.9% in 2018, according to a recent Vanguard report.Said Lorna Sabbia, head of retirement and personal wealth solutions at Bank of America: “This year, more employees are understandably prioritizing short-term expenses over long-term saving.”Immediate bill paying stress vs. long-term retirement savings (Getty Creative)The question is: Will the siphoning continue once inflation cools? Maybe not.The SECURE 2.0 Act that passed at the end of 2022 created six new ways to access retirement accounts penalty-free before age 59 ½ as a way to encourage workers to contribute more by making it easier to tap those funds if needed without penalty.Still, Parrish said he “wouldn’t draw too big a conclusion from short-term data. It suggests that employers may want to assure they provide at least some education to employees about their plans.”Kerry Hannon is a Senior Reporter and Columnist at Yahoo Finance.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- A push to return more British workers into the office risks undercutting a surge in the hours that women spend on the job, reversing one of the few positive trends for the economy.Women in the UK are putting in more time at work than ever before thanks to “hybrid work” policies that sprang up during the pandemic, allowing employees to split their time between the office and home, an analysis of official data by Bloomberg shows.Analysts and employment experts warn that those gains, which have helped ease strains in a tight labor market, are at risk as businesses dial back flexibility.Those conclusions shed light on trends in the labor market that the Bank of England is watching carefully as it gages how high it must push up interest rates to contain inflation. A drop in the number of people in the workforce during the pandemic pushed up wages and is feeding through to higher prices that the government and central bank want to halt.Government data from the Office for National Statistics shows the number of hours worked in the UK is finally back above pre-pandemic levels, unwinding the impact of lockdowns that shut businesses and pushed employees onto a state-supported furlough program.It’s women who have driven that rebound, ONS data show, with hours worked per woman are up almost 5% on levels before Covid-19 struck. Men, on the other hand, are spending fewer hours on the job — accelerating the downward trend that began in the decade before the first Covid lockdown.The findings indicate a bit of relief for tightness in the UK labor market, where vacancies remain near record highs and workers are in short supply due to Brexit and a surge in long-term sickness since the pandemic. The uptick in women’s working hours is easing some of that pressure. The ONS will deliver a fresh batch of figures on Aug. 15.Story continuesFor Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s government, which is desperate to get inflation down ahead of a general election expected next year, easing pressure on the labor market while keeping as many people employed as possible is a big priority. Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt has vowed to extend state-backed free childcare hours to younger children, but there’s still a question about how this will be funded and if there’s enough carers to meet demand.Initially, the pandemic was a setback for working parents, since they had to juggle jobs with full-time child care. Women were hardest hit since they took the biggest care responsibilities. But as nurseries and schools reopened, hybrid work practices made it easier for people to spend time on the job while making sure their children were where they needed to be. The data show women took advantage of that flexibility to spend more hours on the job.The concern is that some businesses are working against the favorable trend. JPMorgan Chase, Amazon.com Inc., Blackrock and Goldman Sachs are at the vanguard of limiting hybrid work, asking for staff to spend more time in the office and reducing the flexibility that has brought more work from women.“Covid taught us a lot of things when we were right in the middle of it,” said Louise Ballard, co-founder of business consultancy Beyondable, which aims to empower female workers. “And then there’s just been this slow creep back on so many levels.”Tony Wilson, director of the Institute for Employment Studies, thinks the increase in women’s hours and the drop in men’s “likely broadly reflects people being able to work more of the hours that they want in a tight labor market.”More women have shifted from part-time to full-time work, according to the ONS data. There’s also been a drop in the number who say they’re working part-time because they couldn’t find full-time jobs.Meanwhile, the number of men taking on part-time jobs has jumped along with the portion who say it’s because they don’t want a full-time position.All of this suggests there has been some shift in the way household chores are being balanced by couples, Wilson says. The rise in women working longer hours “has probably been supported by more parents being able to stay working full time — or return to full time — because it’s a bit easier to do that in a hybrid world,” he adds.Daniela Korn, co-owner and head of the employment practice at law firm Tan Ward, saw many of her senior executive clients upping their hours and going full-time when Covid offered them a more flexible schedule.“Previously, the flexibility would’ve cost them quite clearly in terms of their salary,” she says. “There’s now an opportunity for them to be able to work more hours, but in a manner that suits them.”Pandemic lockdowns may have also made some men realize the possibilities that part-time work can offer, Wilson says.Research has also suggested women are bearing the brunt of Britain’s inflation crisis, and it’s possible this could be causing many to take on overtime and second jobs to help pay the bills. While the number of people with second jobs has increased above pre-pandemic levels, according to ONS data, this is adding to women’s working hours far more than men’s.“The balancing act between working life and caring responsibilities was put firmly under the microscope during the pandemic,” says Lisa Fernihough, chief people officer at KPMG UK. “One of the few positives to come out of the pandemic was more flexible working.”Read more:--With assistance from Irina Anghel.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: (Adds background on Dinh's career in paragraphs 5-6)Aug 11 (Reuters) - Fox Corp said on Friday that Chief Legal Officer Viet Dinh was stepping down, a high-profile exit that follows its $787.5 million settlement in April of a defamation lawsuit filed by Dominion Voting Systems over its 2020 U.S. election coverage.Dinh, who will exit the role at the end of 2023, joined Fox in 2018 and headed its legal and compliance divisions during the months-long legal battle sparked by the network's coverage of false claims that Dominion rigged the election.The move marks another major departure at the network since the settlement. Top-rated host Tucker Carlson agreed to part ways with Fox in April, just days after the legal resolution.As part of a separation agreement, Dinh will get a lump-sum cash payment of $23 million, Fox said. He will become a special adviser to the company after leaving the role of legal head.He was a former U.S. attorney general under President George W Bush and an architect of the Patriot Act, the U.S. national security law enacted after the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.He founded Bancroft PLLC, a small Washington, D.C.-based litigation firm known for advocating conservative causes that was acquired by Kirkland & Ellis in 2016. Dinh's clients as a defense lawyer included billionaire real estate developer Ng Lap Seng, who was convicted of bribery in 2017.In June, Fox Corp also settled a lawsuit by former Fox News producer Abby Grossberg, who claimed gender discrimination and accused the network's lawyers of pressuring her to make misleading statements in the Dominion Voting Systems case.

Text Content: NEW YORK (AP) — Fox Corp. said Friday that its chief legal officer who oversaw a $787 million settlement with Dominion Voting Systems over defamation allegations is leaving the company.Viet Dinh, Fox's chief legal and policy officer, will step down effective Dec. 31, the New York-based company said in a statement. He will remain a “special advisor” to Fox Corp., it added.Fox News, a unit of Fox Corp., agreed to settle the case brought by the voting machine producer in mid-April following weeks of pretrial disclosures that revealed the network had aired false claims about the 2020 U.S. presidential election, even though many within the company knew they were not true.The company did not say why Dinh was leaving Fox Corp. Brian Nick, a spokesman for Fox, said the company had no comment beyond the statement.Records released as part of the lawsuit showed Fox aired the claims in part to win back viewers who were fleeing the network after it correctly called hotly contested Arizona for Democrat Joe Biden on election night. One Fox Corp. vice president called the claims “MIND BLOWINGLY NUTS.”During a deposition, Fox Chairman Rupert Murdoch testified that he believed the 2020 election was fair and had not been stolen from former President Donald Trump.

Text Content: (Recasts with attempted attack on bridge, more background)Aug 12 (Reuters) - Russia's Defence Ministry said on Saturday that Ukraine had tried unsuccessfully to strike the Crimean Bridge across the Kerch Strait with S-200 rockets, but that no damage or casualties had been caused.The 12-mile (19-km) bridge, which links Russian-annexed Crimea to Russia, has come under repeated attack from Ukrainian forces since Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022."The Ukrainian missile was detected in a timely manner and was intercepted in the air by Russian air defence systems. No damage or casualties were reported," the ministry said in a statement.In a statement posted earlier on the Telegram messaging app, Russian-installed Crimea governor Sergei Aksyonov said two rockets had been downed by anti-aircraft defences near the bridge. He also said the bridge was undamaged.Footage circulating on Russian social media on Saturday appeared to show the bridge wreathed in smoke. Reuters could not verify the footage. Interfax news agency reported that the bridge was briefly shut to traffic but that it later reopened.Separately, Russian forces destroyed 20 Ukrainian drones launched onto the Crimean Peninsula earlier on Saturday, Russia's Defence Ministry said.There were no casualties and no damage as a result of the drone attacks, the ministry said on Telegram. It said 14 drones were destroyed by air defence systems and six were suppressed by electronic warfare.Reuters could not independently verify the report.It was not immediately clear what was targeted in those reported attacks on the Black Sea peninsula, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014.Drone attacks on Russian-controlled territories in Ukraine and deep inside Russia have increased since a drone was destroyed over the Kremlin in early May.Ukraine almost never publicly claims responsibility for the attacks but has said destroying Russia's military infrastructure is crucial for Kyiv's counteroffensive.Story continuesThe Crimean Bridge was badly damaged last October in a powerful blast that Russian officials said was caused by a truck that blew up while crossing the bridge, killing three people.Ukraine's SBU domestic intelligence agency later claimed responsibility for the sabotage operation.The bridge, which is the only direct link between the transport network of Russia and the peninsula, was a flagship project for Russian President Vladimir Putin, who opened it for road traffic to much fanfare by driving a truck across in 2018.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- China’s economy is showing little sign of a rebound, with fresh stress in the property market and deflation threatening the growth outlook.Official data on Tuesday will likely show modest gains in industrial output, retail sales and fixed-assets investment in July from a year ago, although growth rates are still well below pre-pandemic levels.Real estate investment probably shrank further, with confidence shaken by a possible default by a major developer and housing sales continuing to fall as well.Adding to the gloom, heavy rain and deadly floods last month in the southwest and more recently in the north of China likely hindered construction and infrastructure projects, curbing economic activity.The numbers follow economic news in the past week that showed deflation arriving in July as manufacturers and retailers cut prices in a bid to lure buyers and move excess stock. Exports and imports also plunged more than expected, while borrowing by consumers and businesses slumped.Beijing has made several pledges and announced incremental measures to support growth, but has avoided the kind of monetary and fiscal stimulus implemented during previous downturns. A weaker yuan and high debt levels have prompted more caution.The government also set a fairly conservative growth target of about 5% for the year, which remains on track even without major stimulus. The People’s Bank of China is likely to keep a key policy interest rate unchanged at 2.65% on Tuesday, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“The economy needs more support. We see the central bank delivering it in the third quarter by freeing up more cash for banks to lend and trimming borrowing costs further.”Story continues—For full analysis, click hereElsewhere, US data may show resilient consumer demand, UK wage and inflation numbers will guide investors betting on future Bank of England rate hikes, and Japanese growth statistics will also be released.Click here for what happened last week, and below is our wrap of what’s coming up in the global economy.US and CanadaFollowing reports in the past week showing inflation is moderating, fresh snapshots of retail demand, home construction and factory output will set the tone for the economy at the start of the third quarter.In addition, the Federal Reserve on Wednesday will serve up minutes of its July policy meeting, at which officials boosted rates a quarter of a percentage point to a 22-year high. Investors will gauge the account for clues on the appetite for further hikes, though odds favor a pause in September.On Tuesday, a report is forecast to show retail sales picked up in July. Resilience in consumer demand, augmented by a still-healthy labor market, would underscore views that the economy has scope to avoid a recession.The following day, separate data may show an increase in July new-home construction as builders respond to lean inventories in the resale market. An increase in starts of single-family homes would be the fifth in the last six months.While housing is showing signs of stabilizing, manufacturing is struggling for momentum. A Fed report is projected to show factory production little changed last month after two months of declines.Turning north, Statistics Canada will release inflation data for July, after the consumer price index slowed to 2.8% in June. That was the first time in two years that it fell within the Bank of Canada’s control range.AsiaAway from China, Indian data on Monday will reveal if inflation accelerated in July.Japanese numbers on Tuesday are expected to show the economic expansion continued in the second quarter, while price data Friday are forecast to show inflation remained well above the Bank of Japan’s target in July.Also on Tuesday, the Reserve Bank of Australia will release minutes from its August meeting, where it held rates steady, ahead of fresh labor statistics on Thursday that may show employment growth slowing.In neighboring New Zealand, which just saw its first monthly drop in food prices since early 2022, the central bank is expected to hold rates steady on Wednesday, while its counterpart in the Philippines is forecast to stand pat on Thursday.Malaysia unveils second-quarter gross domestic product statistics on Friday.Europe, Middle East, AfricaAfter news of the UK economy’s resilience in the second quarter, fresh data will help determine the Bank of England’s resolve in enacting further rate hikes, with the first of two months of key reports due before the Sept. 20 decision.Wage numbers on Tuesday will show the extent that higher prices are feeding through into self-reinforcing pay pressures. Then, July inflation data on Wednesday are likely to reveal a significant slowdown, though an underlying gauge stripping out energy and other volatile elements is seen barely budging.In the euro zone, the week will be interrupted in many countries - including France and Italy - by holidays on Tuesday.Aside from German investor confidence that day, traders may focus on potentially revised readings of euro-area GDP and inflation, on Wednesday and Friday respectively, which will show whether recent data — for example, Germany’s industrial production drop — recast the overall picture for the economy.In the Nordics, Sweden’s consumer-price report on Tuesday will draw attention, at a time when the Riksbank remains committed to tightening even as evidence of its impact on the economy becomes increasingly clear.On Thursday, Norges Bank may deliver a quarter-point rate hike flagged at its last decision, after slowing core consumer-price growth eased pressure on policymakers to go for a bigger move.Turning south, investors on Tuesday will find out if inflation in Israel decelerated for a third month in July. That could make the Bank of Israel — which recently said it might not be done with rate hiking — less inclined to further tighten policy.The same day, Nigerian data will likely show inflation surged beyond June’s 22.8% level, stoked by the removal of fuel subsidies and the devaluation of the naira.In Uganda, monetary officials are expected to stand pat for a fifth meeting after the inflation rate fell below the central bank’s 5% target in the past two months. Two days later, on Thursday, Rwanda is also likely to keep rates on hold.Latin AmericaManufacturing, industrial output and retail sales data for June published this week should underscore a dramatic slowdown in Colombia’s economyQuarter-on-quarter output likely declined for the first time since 2021 in the three months through June, while the year-on-year result and June’s GDP-proxy reading stalled.Chile’s central bank, led by chief Rosanna Costa, turned heads by kicking off its easing cycle with a bigger-than-expected 100 basis-point rate cut last month, so the minutes of that meeting, due on Monday, will be a must-read for Chile watchers.Banco Central de Chile will also post its survey of traders along with its second-quarter output report, which is widely expected to show a mild contraction as first-half mining activity disappointed.Data posted in Peru this week may show that unemployment in Lima declined for a fourth month in July.GDP-proxy data are likely to show output fell in June, Finance Minister Alex Contreras said this month, which would mean the economy posted consecutive quarter-on-quarter contractions in the first half of 2023.In Argentina, the July consumer price report will likely show an 18th straight year-on-year rise from June’s 115.6% reading.The central bank, which raised its key rate to 97% in May, often follows up on inflation data with monetary policy announcements.--With assistance from Nasreen Seria, Vince Golle, Paul Jackson, Monique Vanek, Paul Wallace and Robert Jameson.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Argentines begin casting ballots Sunday in a critical primary election that will provide a key barometer of expectations for the general vote two months later.With markets anticipating a change of government in the October election, the key focus will be on how the business-friendly opposition party performs against the incumbent Peronist bloc, as well as the support for a third-party outsider candidate.Economy Minister Sergio Massa faces an uphill bid to get his ruling government coalition reelected this year with inflation over 115% and a recession expected this year. He’s competing against the main opposition bloc that’s fielding two candidates, Buenos Aires Mayor Horacio Rodriguez Larreta and former security minister Patricia Bullrich — one of whom will advance as the sole contender for the Oct. 22 vote.Investors will be comparing the total number of votes for Larreta and Bullrich combined against the tally for Massa’s coalition and outsider Javier Milei. While it’s possible Massa could receive more votes than any other individual candidate, markets have focused on the vote difference between the coalitions.Read More: Argentina’s Primary Election Has Investors Flying BlindA history of unreliable polling and apathy among voters have increased the uncertainty around election results. Four years ago, a similar primary ended in an unexpected defeat of the then-ruling pro-business opposition party. That triggered a collapse in Argentinian assets, including a 48% decline in dollar terms of the S&P Merval stock index that was the second-biggest one-day rout on any of the 94 stock exchanges tracked by Bloomberg going back to 1950.Story continuesRead More: Malbec, Coldplay, Qatar: A Guide to Argentina’s Myriad FX RatesPolls are scheduled to end at 6 p.m. local time on Sunday, but it’s common for voting to be extended by an hour or two if people are waiting in long lines to cast ballots. Results will start to arrive after 9 p.m. Buenos Aires province, by far Argentina’s most populous and politically relevant, is often the last district to report results.A significant victory for the opposition bloc — investors say 35% to 40% would be a strong performance — would be positive for the country’s sovereign bonds. However, if Milei or Massa perform better than expected, pulling within 5 percentage points of the opposition, uncertainty could roil markets on Monday.Two violent murders in recent days, including the killing of an 11-year-old schoolgirl who was attacked for her mobile phone, may impact voter sentiment. The cases took place on the outskirts of Buenos Aires, a traditional bastion of the Peronist party, and forced campaigns to cancel their closing rallies ahead of Sunday’s vote.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: DUBAI (Reuters) - A U.S.-led naval coalition in the Gulf has warned ships in the region to stay away from Iranian waters to avoid possible seizure, the U.S. Navy said.The warning shows tensions remain high in and around the Strait of Hormuz, where Iran seized tankers in late April and early May, while Washington and Tehran finalise a deal to free five U.S. citizens detained in Iran and the U.S. allows $6 billion in Iranian funds held in South Korea to be unfrozen."The International Maritime Security Construct is notifying regional mariners of appropriate precautions to minimise the risk of seizure based on current regional tensions, which we seek to de-escalate," Commander Timothy Hawkins, spokesman for the Bahrain-based U.S. Fifth Fleet, said late on Saturday."Vessels are being advised to transit as far away from Iranian territorial waters as possible."About a fifth of the world's crude oil and oil products pass through the Strait of Hormuz, a choke point between Iran and Oman at the mouth of the Gulf.The deal to release U.S. citizens from Iranian prison and allow them to return to the U.S. would remove a major irritant between Washington and Tehran, which remain at odds on issues from the Iranian nuclear programme to Tehran's support for regional Shi'ite militias.The United States would release some Iranians from U.S. prisons as part of the deal, Iran's mission to the United Nations has said.(Reporting by Yousef Saba; Editing by William Mallard)

Source: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review-foldables-are-here-to-stay-190932780.html
Text Content: Samsung’s Galaxy Z Flip 5 is the company’s fifth generation of its clamshell–style foldable smartphone line, and it's also the best example of the South Korean consumer electronics giant's efforts to make foldables the future of its smartphone lineup.After using the Z Flip 5 while traveling in South Korea, it’s the first foldable that’s made me want to switch back to Google's (GOOG, GOOGL) Android from my iPhone. That may sound blasphemous to my iPhone-owning friends who demand our chats remain free of green text bubbles, but the Flip 5 is that impressive.The Z Flip 5 is a welcome departure from the candy bar-style smartphones you’ve been using for more than a decade. Folded, it’s a compact handset that easily slips into your pocket or purse, while still allowing you to access your most important apps from its enlarged front screen.Unfolded, it’s a regular-sized smartphone with all of the features you’d expect from a modern device. But there's one drawback. At $999, the Z Flip 5 is still pricey, even if premium smartphone prices continue to creep ever higher. The Galaxy 23, for instance, starts at $799.The Galaxy Z Flip 5 shows that foldables have finally arrived. (Image: Howley)Samsung also has some stiff competition from rival Motorola’s Razr Plus, which also offers a clamshell look and at the same price.My takeaway: The Z Flip 5 is genuinely a fun, intriguing smartphone that does everything you want with few sacrifices.Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 and screen usageI’ve used and tested every generation of Samsung’s Z Flip line since the company first launched the phone in 2020. And the primary issue I’ve had with the company’s approach has been that its front cover screen was always too small to do much with. That meant having to flip open the phone to actually get anything done, an annoying step that you don’t have to take with a candy bar phone.But with the Z Flip 5 Samsung has dramatically increased the size of its cover screen, which it refers to as its Flex Window, from 1.9 inches on the Z Flip 4 to 3.4 inches. That allows you to do everything from read notifications and reply to messages to check the weather and control your music.Story continuesSamsung also added the ability to run apps on the Flex Window, though, annoyingly, you have to enable the feature in the Z Flip 5’s settings menu.I watched YouTube, navigated using Google Maps and its South Korean equivalent Naver while in Korea, chatted with friends via Whatsapp and Messages, and even browsed Netflix. It makes the Flex Window a heck of a lot more useful, ensuring it’s not just wasted real estate.You can watch YouTube, Netflix, navigate using Google Maps, and more on the Galaxy Z Flip 5's cover screen. (Daniel Howley)Granted, you might not want to binge “Love is Blind” on the 3.4 inch Flex Window. But if you’re in a jam and don’t want to unfold the phone, it’s a nice option.And while Motorola’s Razr Plus can run a boatload more apps on its cover screen and has a slightly larger display (3.6 inches), the Z Flip 5’s panel is a great feature and easily the reason the phone won me over in the first place.Pop open the Z Flip 5, and you’re met by a 6.7-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X display. Yes, the crease is still visible in certain situations. And yes, Samsung says it’s trying to figure out a way to get rid of it in future phones. But for now, this is the technology’s limits.It’s not as though the crease is a deal-breaker, either. I didn’t notice it when browsing the web, watching shows, or firing off emails. And while you can feel it when scrolling up and down the display, it’s not a distraction.Pop open the Galaxy Z Flip 5 and it's like any other smartphone. (Daniel Howley)Samsung has also brought back its Flex Mode feature, which allows you to open the Z Flip 5 half way, using its bottom as a base that allows it to sit upright.The mode lets you watch YouTube on the top half of the screen, while scrolling through videos on the bottom half. You can similarly use the feature with camera mode, using the top half of the screen as a viewfinder and the bottom half for photo options.For most people, though, Flex Mode will be most useful when trying to take selfies or group photos without having to hold your phone.Like Samsung’s other phones, you can also launch multiple apps side by side, allowing for quick multitasking.Sign up for the Yahoo Finance newsletter.Camera and performanceThe Galaxy Z Flip 5 comes with two rear-facing cameras: a 12-megapixel ultra-wide lens and 12-megapixel wide-angle lens. Inside, there’s a 10-megapixel selfie camera. I shot photos across a variety of settings while trying out the Z Flip 5 in South Korea and found images to be on a par with what you’d expect from a high-end smartphone.Photos I took in bright sunlight offered sharp details without looking washed out, while shots of crowded nighttime streets balanced harsh neon lights with dimly lit bar windows. In photos taken at a cafe, individual bubbles floated softly atop a latte, while green melons in a parfait stood out nicely against a marble tabletop.A photo taken using the Galaxy Z Flip 5. (Daniel Howley)I do, however, wish Samsung included a telephoto lens with the Z Flip 5, especially considering its price tag. And while I recognize three cameras on the front panel would be difficult considering the size of the phone’s Flex Window, I wish Samsung would’ve ditched the ultra-wide lens for the added benefit of optical zoom.As for performance, the Z Flip 5 runs on Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip and 8GB of RAM. Like most flagship smartphones, I didn’t notice any slowdown while using the Z Flip 5, whether that was bouncing between apps or playing games like “Genshin Impact.”The Z Flip 5’s battery lasted much of the day during my testing despite, taking pictures and using the phone to navigate around Seoul.The Z Flip 5's camera captures fine details such as the tiny bubbles in this shot. (Daniel Howley)The best foldable yet?After using the Z Flip 5 for more than a week, I'm convinced that Samsung managed to finally hit the sweet spot for its foldables formula. The cover screen is finally usable for more than just checking short messages, and its styling and finish feel polished and sturdy enough to serve as a true flagship.The Z Flip 5 is one of the first foldables that Android fans should have little doubt in checking out. If its price tag was a bit lower, it would be a no-brainer. But if you can handle the $999, you won’t be disappointed.Daniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

Text Content: Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Chair Lina Khan will reportedly meet with representatives from Amazon (AMZN) next week in what could be the last face-to-face between the parties before the commission files an antitrust suit against the e-commerce giant.Khan, who became chair in 2021 at 32 years old, has made taking on Big Tech the cornerstone of her tenure at the FTC. She has confronted many of the industry's biggest names, with major lawsuits against Facebook parent Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT).Not all of them have produced victories, resulting in some political blowback in Washington and skepticism that her strategy is to lose so Congress will change antitrust laws.Khan, now 34, rose to prominence after publishing a 2017 article in the Yale Law Journal titled "Amazon's Antitrust Paradox."The article argued modern antitrust laws weren't equipped to tackle the tech industry's anticompetitive behavior because they were too focused on pricing as a means of determining consumer harms.FTC Chair Lina Khan, preparing to testify before a House committee last month. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)Those laws, she argued, needed to be rethought to bring Big Tech companies to heel. Now she is attempting to rein in these companies as chair."Love or hate her, [Khan] has a very clear vision of what the role of the FTC is and what the role of the chair is," former Federal Communications Commission Chair Harold Furchtgott-Roth told Yahoo Finance. "And that vision is a very aggressive and ambitious one and she’s taking every step possible to make that vision become a reality."The FTC declined to comment.The US scrutiny of Big TechKhan isn’t the only government official going after the nation's biggest tech companies.The Department of Justice and a collection of state attorneys general are suing Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) Google in two consolidated cases launched during President Trump’s administration, alleging the company abuses its market power across search and search advertising to squeeze competition.Story continuesThose cases go to trial next month before the US District Court of the District of Columbia, which has dismissed some of the claims.Google said "we look forward to showing at trial that promoting and distributing our services is both legal and pro-competitive."This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Khan is juggling cases against several other giants. In one case against Facebook-owning Meta, the FTC under Khan tried to block Meta's acquisition of virtual reality fitness company Within.Her agency is also trying to force the social media juggernaut to split apart Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, in a separate case filed before Khan took over as chair.Another target: Microsoft. Khan has fought to prevent the Windows maker from completing its acquisition of "Call of Duty" developer Activision Blizzard (ATVI).But Khan’s biggest test will be her challenge against Amazon. The suit, according to Politico, will likely focus on Amazon’s e-commerce business and whether it puts unfair pressure on sellers who use its marketplace.These arguments echo complaints made by the state of California and Washington DC, which argued that Amazon’s pressure on these sellers forced them to hike prices outside of the Amazon platform.Amazon has denied those claims, saying sellers set their own prices and that Amazon makes no effort to prevent them from offering lower prices elsewhere. The case filed by Washington DC was thrown out by a judge last year, and the California case is ongoing.An Amazon worker moves boxes last month in New York City. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)If FTC does decide to sue Amazon, it would be Khan's second case against the company. A separate lawsuit the commission filed in July accuses Amazon of tricking consumers into signing up for its Prime service and purposely making it difficult to cancel those subscriptions.Amazon declined to comment.Pushback in WashingtonKhan’s efforts, however, haven’t always been successful. In July, a federal judge blocked the commission’s request for an injunction seeking to keep Microsoft from completing the deal. The FTC has since pulled out of its in-house suit, and will likely negotiate with Microsoft over potential concessions for the deal.The commission also failed in its battle to prevent Meta from being able to purchase VR company Within.During a July hearing before the House Judiciary Committee, some Republicans pounced on Khan’s failures, calling her a "bully" and arguing that her leadership of the agency had been a "disaster."But at least one expert says that the FTC is moving in the right direction despite recent misses."I think the FTC is doing the right thing in trying to rein in mergers and challenging self-preferencing rules," Stanford Law School Professor Mark A. Lemley told Yahoo Finance."I think they have run up against 40 years of entrenched (and outdated) attitudes that disfavor antitrust law, which has led to them losing cases in the courts that they clearly should have won," Lemley added. "It's not obvious to me how we can change that judicial resistance without legislation."Sign up for the Yahoo Finance newsletter.Khan’s prior losses against tech firms also have little to do with the FTC’s chances in any potential case against Amazon, explained NYU School of Law professor Eleanor Fox."I know the press makes a huge deal of losing the first case and losing the second case, but the fact is…it was just lost because of proof of fact," Fox said. "And it really doesn't say a lot about what will happen next time in a big case."Khan’s potential tussle with Amazon would be among the most important battles between the Biden Administration and Big Tech. Whether it actually plays out at all could depend on Khan’s showdown with the company next week.Daniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

Text Content: By Aditya Kalra and Munsif VengattilNEW DELHI (Reuters) -India's Adani Ports on Saturday said Deloitte's reasoning to quit as auditor of the company was "not convincing or sufficient to warrant such a move" and the global firm had all the necessary information it required to conduct the process.Deloitte had decided to resign from the role amid concerns over certain related party transactions flagged in a report by U.S. short seller Hindenburg in January, but the Indian company did not wish to look into them independently, a source told Reuters on Friday.The auditor's resignation has brought fresh scrutiny of the financial management at Adani Group, led by Indian billionaire Gautam Adani. The group has denied Hindenburg's allegations made around alleged improper use of tax havens and other business dealings.Speaking for the first time on the matter, Adani Ports in a statement said in meetings with its leadership, Deloitte indicated a lack of a wider audit role as auditors of other listed Adani companies, but it was conveyed it was not within the remit of Adani Ports to recommend such appointments as other entities are "completely independent.""The Audit Committee (of Adani Ports) was of the view that the grounds advanced by Deloitte for resignation as Statutory Auditor were not convincing or sufficient to warrant such a move," it said."Deloitte was not willing to continue as ... auditor and, therefore, it was agreed to amicably end the client-auditor contractual relationship."Deloitte did not immediately respond to a request for comment.After the Hindenburg report, Adani group stocks lost about $150 billion in market value, but have since regained by around $50 billion after it paid debt and gained confidence of investors such as Australia-listed investment firm GQG Partners.This month, Adani's Ambuja Cements said it would buy a majority stake in smaller rival Sanghi Industries for up to $295 million, its first major purchase since the Hindenburg turmoil.Story continuesAdani Ports has named MSKA & Associates, an independent member firm of BDO International, as its new auditor, it said in the statement.Deloitte in May first pointed to certain transactions flagged by Hindenburg in its report and gave only a qualified opinion related to Adani Ports, indicating concerns by a company's auditor.(Reporting by Aditya Kalra in New Delhi, Editing by Ros Russell)

Text Content: DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Western-backed maritime forces in the Middle East on Saturday warned shippers traveling through the strategic Strait of Hormuz to stay as far away from Iranian territorial waters as possible to avoid being seized, a stark advisory amid heightened tensions between Iran and the U.S.A similar warning went out to shippers earlier this year ahead of Iran seizing two tankers traveling near the strait, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf through which 20% of the world's oil passes.While Iran and the U.S. now near an apparent deal that would see billions of Iranian assets held in South Korea unfrozen in exchange for the release of five Iranian-Americans detained in Tehran, the warning shows that the tensions remain high at sea. Already, the U.S. is exploring plans to put armed troops on commercial ships in the strait to deter Iran amid a buildup of troops, ships and aircraft in the region.U.S. Navy Cmdr. Timothy Hawkins, a spokesman for the Mideast-based 5th Fleet, acknowledged the warning had been given, but declined to discuss specifics about it.A U.S.-backed maritime group called the International Maritime Security Construct “is notifying regional mariners of appropriate precautions to minimize the risk of seizure based on current regional tensions, which we seek to de-escalate,” Hawkins said. “Vessels are being advised to transit as far away from Iranian territorial waters as possible.”Separately, a European Union-led maritime organization watching shipping in the strait has “warned of a possibility of an attack on a merchant vessel of unknown flag in the Strait of Hormuz in the next 12 to 72 hours,” said private intelligence firm Ambrey.“Previously, after a similar warning was issued, a merchant vessel was seized by Iranian authorities under a false pretext,” the firm warned.The EU-led mission, called the European Maritime Awareness in the Strait of Hormuz, did not respond to a request for comment.Story continuesHours later, the British military's United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations, which also provides warnings to sailors in the Persian Gulf, issued its own alert.“UKMTO have been made aware of an increased threat within the vicinity of Strait Of Hormuz," the warning said. ”All vessels transiting are advised to exercise caution and report suspicious activity to UKMTO."Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency cited this AP report without quoting any Iranian officials about it. Iran’s mission to the United Nations did not respond to a request for comment.The Strait of Hormuz is in the territorial waters of Iran and Oman, which at its narrowest point is just 33 kilometers (21 miles) wide. The width of the shipping lane in either direction is only 3 kilometers (2 miles). Anything affecting it ripples through global energy markets, potentially raising the price of crude oil. That then trickles down to consumers through what they pay for gasoline and other oil products.There has been a wave of attacks on ships attributed to Iran since 2019, following the Trump administration unilaterally withdrawing America from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and re-imposing crushing sanctions on Tehran.Those assaults resumed in late April, when Iran seized a ship carrying oil for Chevron Corp. and another tanker called the Niovi in May.The taking of the two tankers in under a week comes as the Marshall Island-flagged Suez Rajan sits off Houston, likely waiting to offload sanctioned Iranian oil apparently seized by the U.S.Those seizures led the U.S. military to launch a major deployment in the region, including thousands of Marines and sailors on both the amphibious assault ship USS Bataan and the USS Carter Hall, a landing ship. Images released by the Navy showed the Bataan and Carter Hall in the Red Sea on Tuesday.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Deep within the underbelly of the options world lies a threat to the stock-market calm that’s prevailed all year.While benchmark indexes just limped to one of their smallest weekly changes of 2023, intraday moves tell a different story. Up-and-down swings in the S&P 500 are the widest since June and double what they were last month. Twice in the past six sessions the index’s futures erased a 0.9% gain, the first time that’s happened since February.While uncertainty about the economy and central bank policy was one instigator, something else may be contributing to the volatility: Market makers repositioning their exposures. There’s evidence that these Wall Street dealers — with the capacity to move millions of shares to hedge their books — have shifted to a posture where their selling has the potential to exacerbate market swings.Any turbulence is likely to be temporary and betting against price swings remains a popular trade. But this change in dealer positioning is a departure from the first seven months of the year when the cohort played a major role curbing price swings, according to a model kept by Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s managing director Scott Rubner.“Market moves are exacerbated, and no longer muted,” Rubner, who has studied flow of funds for two decades, wrote in a note Thursday. “This is new.”Stocks fell for a second week as a mixed bag of inflation data added to an already heated debate about whether the Federal Reserve is finished hiking rates and how long the economy can avoid a recession. The S&P 500 slipped 0.3%, while the Nasdaq 100 capped a two-week retreat in which it has fallen 4.6%.Story continuesFor the five sessions through Thursday, the S&P 500 posted an average intraday swing of 1.1% — the widest gyration since June, data compiled by Bloomberg show. While the oscillation pales in comparison to 2022’s bear market, it’s almost double the average daily move from just two weeks ago.“There’s still the potential for soft landing and there’s still a potential for like a consumer retraction, which leads to a corporate profit contraction,” said Tom Hainlin, national investment strategist at US Bank Wealth Management. “People are trading on the two range of outcomes, so you’ve just got this push and pull.”A potential accelerant in the process is captured by the concept known in derivatives parlance as gamma, or the theoretical value of stock that option dealers must sell or buy to hedge against the directional risk resulting from price changes in the underlying assets.To be sure, getting a clear read on the interplay between the vast derivatives universe and the underlying shares isn’t easy. Oftentimes, models built on subjective assumptions spit out different numbers on how much market-maker hedging is required in a given scenario. While not an exact science, such analysis offers a lens into the potential impact from the complex derivatives world on the cash market.And right now, two widely followed Wall Street trading desks are sounding alarms over potential turbulence on the horizon as option dealers move away from their “long gamma” position — a status that previously obliged them to go against the prevailing market trend, selling stocks when they go up, or vice versa.By Goldman’s model, the group’s exposure to S&P 500 options flipped this week to negative for the first time this year, while that for all index contracts was the most short since last October.The shift was also detected by a Morgan Stanley team led by Christopher Metli, who flagged dealers’ exposure plunged more than 80% from a few weeks ago. The pullback, the team observed, coincided with a slowdown in volatility selling — the kind of activity increasingly driven by exchange-traded funds that sell call contracts for income.That, combined with the activity of leveraged ETFs right now — those employing derivatives to generate performance that’s multiple times that of the underlying asset — means the market is susceptible to larger moves, according to the Morgan Stanley team.“The Street will sell into a down tape and buy into an up tape,” they wrote. “This is likely temporary – but for now, it leaves the market free to move.”There are signs that traders are hesitant to bid up stocks after a 10-month, 28% rally pushed the S&P 500’s price-earnings ratio to elevated levels that were reached only twice in the past three decades. Funds focusing on US stocks just had their first outflow in three weeks, according to Bank of America Corp., citing data from EPFR Global.Down almost 3% into August, the S&P 500 is off to its worst start of a month since March. The retreat, if it continues, could prompt an exodus from systematic money managers that make asset allocation based on volatility and momentum signals, according to Goldman’s Rubner.Thanks to a steady advance in equities this year, these rules-based funds have rushed to buy stocks, with positioning among volatility-targeting strategies hovering near a decade high.Commodity trading advisers, or CTAs that surf the momentum of asset prices through long and short bets in the futures market, have loaded up so much stock that Rubner says even a small pullback would set off a violent unwinding. One number to watch, he says, is the S&P 500’s 50-day moving average. That trend line, currently near 4,438, hasn’t been breached since the banking crisis in March.A dip below 4,278 could turn the medium-term momentum to negative for CTAs, his model shows. That level is near the index’s 100-day average.“This is the theme here, if we start rolling downhill, there is an accelerant based on positioning and rules based trading,” Rubner wrote. “Volatility is a player on the field and no longer the coach.”For much of 2023, US stocks have spent the time grinding higher with subdued volatility. Even after the recent increase, the Cboe Volatility Index, a gauge of cost in S&P 500 options known as VIX, hovers below its long-term average, poised for its calmest year since 2019.A further pickup in volatility could ignite a rush for risk-off, just as it happened during the banking turmoil in March, according to Bob Elliott, chief investment officer at Unlimited. Many investors came into the year defensively positioned only to find themselves getting dragged into a resilient market.“A big part of what has driven the rally, particularly in stocks, is low volatility in aggregate has led to people willing to take on more risk in the system,” Elliott said. “But if we transition to a period where there is more volatility, as we’ve seen in the last few weeks, that’s likely to constrain the leverage that investors are willing to apply to their positions and cause a drag on asset prices and eventually the economy.”--With assistance from Isabelle Lee.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Ecuador, still grieving from the assassination of presidential candidate Fernando Villavicencio, is a week away from an election that investors are betting will result in a dose of stability in the Andean nation.In the wake of the tragedy, Ecuador’s global bonds closed out their best week in a month, offering evidence that some on Wall Street expect the nation’s next leader to address a surge in crime and steady the economy.“After elections, they will continue to follow policies that will be more constructive than what the market has currently priced into the bonds,” said Shamaila Khan, head of emerging markets and Asia Pacific at UBS Asset Management Americas Inc. “That policy backdrop, regardless of who gets elected, will be more orthodox than what the market is expecting.”The country owes $15.5 billion in sovereign bonds, according to the Finance Ministry. Its notes due in 2035 climbed as much as 3 cents in the past week, though the debt remains deep in distress at about 37 cents on the dollar, according to indicative price data compiled by Bloomberg.The rise came as investors saw the death of Villavicencio, an anti-graft crusader, equating to a lower likelihood of the return of Correismo — a leftist, anti-investor political philosophy popularized by former President Rafael Correa. Instead, the odds have swung in favor of more conservative challengers, like Otto Sonnenholzner or Jan Topic, against Correista candidate Luisa Gonzalez.“Bonds are fairly pricing the risks going into the election,” said Katrina Butt, senior economist at AllianceBernstein. “But, uncertainty is still high.”Story continuesThe country has been reeling from months of political uncertainty after opponents mounted an impeachment campaign against President Guillermo Lasso, prompting him to close congress and trigger a snap vote. The latest wave of political violence has added an even deeper sense of desperation.Investor attention is already converging on a likely runoff election, which would take place Oct. 15 as long as none of the candidates have an absolute majority in the August vote — or at least 40% of valid votes with a 10 percentage point lead over the runner-up.Villavicencio’s name will remain on the August ballot, which had been printed before his assassination. Ecuadorean law prohibits his running mate from taking his place in the campaign, and the Movimiento Construye party hasn’t named a replacement.Investors have taken that as a potential positive for the bonds, as it may funnel votes toward center-right candidates Sonnenholzner or Topic, who are seen as more likely to honor the country’s debt obligations and work to regain access to international capital markets.“Conservative candidate chances seem to have increased, and a second round could be more contested than anticipated,” said William Snead, a strategist at BBVA. “Even with the recent rally, I believe Ecuador’s bonds still look attractive and have more upside potential.”Deep RiskA risk to debtholders could come if a runoff vote emerges between socialist Gonzalez and Yaku Perez, an environmentalist and indigenous rights leader who is hostile to oil and mining and came fourth in the most recent polls.“At then end of the day this is Gonzalez’s race to lose,” said Patrick Esteruelas at EMSO Asset Management. “That has been the market’s main concern.”What’s clear, regardless, is the deep risk inherent in Ecuador’s debt. Investors ask for an extra 19 percentage points of yield to hold Ecuador’s dollar debt, on average, over similar US Treasuries, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. data.Credit-default swaps, meantime, imply a 92% chance that the nation defaults over the next five years. Those are concerning odds given that Ecuador restructured its bonds in 2020 and faces no major payments until 2026.“Ecuador needs to re-establish market access before these 2026 amortization begin,” said Carlos de Sousa, emerging-markets money manager at Vontobel Asset Management AG in Zurich, “or it would otherwise have to restructure its debts once again.”--With assistance from Stephan Kueffner.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: Inflation cooled for a year, and it helped the tech sector find some heat.Tech is incredibly sensitive to inflation trends, because it's especially sensitive to interest rate fluctuations. When inflation is high, the Federal Reserve feels compelled to raise rates (and vice versa), which can affect the valuations of growth stocks, such as tech."Inflation is not necessarily negative for technology," Spear Invest founder Ivana Delevska said. "It's more about what inflation implies for the direction of interest rates. ... All tech sub-sectors will benefit from lower interest rates. A roughly 50 basis point move in interest rates is [about a] 10% impact for stocks."This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Market participants largely expect the Federal Reserve to maintain its current benchmark rate at September's FOMC meeting, the CME FedWatch Tool shows. And the Fed's latest dot-plot projection indicates Fed officials aren't looking for lower rates until the end of 2024."Cooling inflation suggests less need to raise rates, which have an inverse relationship with tech valuations given the long duration," Wells Fargo analyst Michael Turrin told Yahoo Finance. "Most tech companies are still in growth mode, hence investors are valuing [free cash flow] well into the future.""The lower long-term real interest rates, the less difficult it is to justify the valuations currently observed at many tech and other digital stocks," DWS Americas chief investment officer David Bianco added.Tech's pricing powerIt's also worth considering how inflation affects pricing. Some tech is often seen as having a "deflationary effect" due to improvements in productivity, and the chance to lower prices could spur growth for consumer-facing tech companies."Inflation also helped stress test which vendors have pricing power," Turrin said. "Lower inflation likely allows companies to moderate price increases, leaving more room for price-driven growth in future periods as needed."Story continuesOf course, the inflation picture isn't without its complications, as companies now have to adjust to a mixed environment for prices.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.In July, inflation ticked up again, but the higher-than-expected price increases were nevertheless muted compared to the highs of 2022.So how should investors be thinking about the relationship between tech and inflation moving forward?"The technology sector has traditionally been viewed as a cyclical sector, which means that it isn't immune to the macro forces of an economic cycle," Glenmede portfolio manager Jordan Irving told Yahoo Finance. "The previous decade of low to no inflation and a zero interest rate policy, however, caused a shift in the investment narrative which led to a belief that tech was immune to the conventional macro forces."The narrative has been in flux, Irving added, so expect that to continue as inflation and interest rates drive toward some sort of normalization."The struggle that investors face today is that inflation may be cooling from its highest levels, but interest rates aren't," Irving said. "Should inflation prove stickier than consensus believes and interest rates remain at their current levels, it is likely that investors will question the valuation multiples that are currently being assigned to many tech stocks."Google logo is seen on a balloon at Google office in a historical building at the Main Square in Krakow, Poland on November 29, 2022. (Photo by Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto via Getty Images)Nevertheless, there are sectors and companies that are looking solid.Turrin is "bullish on software as inflation impacts lessen," including Microsoft (MSFT), Adobe (ADBE), Salesforce (CRM), and ServiceNow (NOW).And it won't just be the biggest names in tech that stand to benefit."There are many small to mid-cap companies in software and semiconductors that offer compelling opportunities at their current valuations while money flows gravitate to the mega caps," Irving said.-Allie Garfinkle is a Senior Tech Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Text Content: There was a lot of buzz in the beer industry this week as two brands bulked up their portfolio and another slimmed down.On Tuesday, cannabis and consumer packaged goods giant Tilray (TLRY) scooped up eight beer and beverage brands from Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) for a price tag of $85 million, while Molson Coors (TAP) acquired Blue Run Spirits for an undisclosed price.Both Tilray and Molson Coors are banking that the new brands will build on their existing portfolios and tap into the next big trend."If you are a big branded food and beverage company right now you are looking for the next billion-dollar idea because that's the only way you can really move your earnings numbers," Greg Portell, a lead partner at Kearney Global Markets, told Yahoo Finance. "It's very difficult to create a $100 million brand and all of a sudden make it a billion dollar brand inside those big companies."Tilray aims to make 'craft beer cool again'Tilray has been challenged in recent years as the high around cannabis continues to fade. Shares of the cannabis and consumer brands company are down nearly 90% compared to 2018.As the company waits for weed legalization in the US, it has pushed into adjacent categories, such as beer and spirits. Tilray CEO Irwin Simon told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday he wants to "diversify the brand" and "make sure we were not dependent upon legalization."Tilray's stock soared 36% on Tuesday following the deal, a move Morningstar strategist Kristoffer Inton said he "didn't get." On the deal overall, though, Inton remained ambivalent.On one hand, "it's adding to a [craft beer] strategy that they've had been going down for a bit," Inton said. "Buying these wasn't a surprise, in that sense. It adds to that business."But on the other hand, he added, "I don't see a lot of synergy between cannabis and alcohol," due to their different distribution strategies.Story continuesJose Johnson grabs beers four at a time on the bottling line at the Breckenridge Brewery in Denver.

But for now, he said, the acquisition is aimed at making "craft beer cool again" and ramping up its manufacturing capabilities in the Northeast.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.The acquisition comes as Anheuser-Busch InBev's Bud Light sales are beginning to stabilize after months-long fallout from boycotts over an advertisement for the brand by transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney.Tilray CEO Simon said this acquisition was "totally separate" from the Bud Light controversy. He added that all employees from the respective brands will join Tilray, and the company is "working with them on a transition."In a statement to Yahoo Finance, Anheuser-Busch executive Andy Thomas said that Tilray reached out earlier this year "with interest in purchasing these brands and breweries."Although Anheuser-Busch shed some of its craft beer brands, Thomas added the Bud Light maker is still "committed to its craft brewery partners ... and focused on working with them to lead growth in the segment."Molson Coors exec: Whiskeys, bourbons 'are on fire'In the background, Molson Coors continues to gain momentum.In recent years, the US-Canadian company has been quietly expanding its overall beverage portfolio, partnering with energy drinks, and bringing on spirit brands. In 2020, the company even changed its name from Molson Coors Beer Co. to Molson Coors Beverage Co."Beer will always be central to who we are," Michelle St. Jacques, an executive at Molson Coors Beverage Co., said in a statement to Yahoo Finance. "But we live in a world that extends beyond beer, and we have opportunities beyond beer, so our portfolio should extend beyond beer."Blue Run Spirits is the latest in that strategy."High-end whiskeys, bourbons, and ryes are on fire, and we believe in the future of that space," St. Jacques said. "Our approach is working. Our beers are stronger than they've been in many years. Our portfolio is premiumizing. And we continue to expand our offerings beyond beer."This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.The Kentucky-based bourbon brand, Blue Run, is known for its distinctive butterfly logo. Created in 2020, the founders, all of whom did not come from the industry, found success in "sneakerizing" the bourbon business by doing limited drops, similar to the sneaker business, to build a following.At the same time, St. Jacques added that beer is still core to the business and "have been on an upward trajectory for the past few years"In its quarterly earnings call, CEO Gavin Hattersley said, "Coors Light and Miller Lite, combined, we're 50% bigger than Bud Light by total industry dollars and 30% bigger than [Constellation Brands'] Modelo Especial in the second quarter."Still, it's far from guaranteed that Blue Run Spirits will get more attention following its acquisition by Molson Coors, per Portell, which has a portfolio that consists of a range of offerings from well-known household brands like Coors Light to lesser-known names like Hamm's and Mad Vine clean cola. "Companies that are better at managing smaller niche brands are going to be able to maximize the value of those brands more because they can put more resources to them," Portell said. "Imagine if you are sitting in that big branded company, and you have $1 to invest, where are you going to put it? It's very unlikely it's gonna go to the small niche brand."—Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Bain Capital signed an agreement to take Chindata Group Holdings Ltd. private, a deal that allows the buyout firm to take full ownership of the data center business.The private investment firm will pay $4.30 per ordinary stock and $8.60 per American depositary share, according to the firm’s statement released Friday. That’s roughly in line with a Bloomberg News report. The offer represents a 7.5% increase from the proposed purchase price when the firms first contemplated a takeover.Bain Capital will acquire all of the outstanding shares of the company, together with a number of existing and new investors. Bain already owned about 42.2% of Beijing-based Chindata. The deal implies an equity value of Chindata of about $3.16 billion, according to a press release.“We believe taking Chindata Group private is the best way to provide attractive returns to existing public shareholders and secure the long-term success of the company,” said Jonathan Zhu, partner and co-head of Asia private equity for Bain Capital in the statement.Data centers have become hot assets among investors, in part due to the perception of their having stable returns, and on expectations that their growth will continue as they are needed to power technology that’s becoming ever more reliant on data processing.Chindata operates carrier-neutral data centers in locations including China, India and Malaysia, according to its website. Bain bought Chindata in 2019 from Wangsu Science & Technology Co. and merged it with its portfolio firm Bridge Data Centers. In 2020, Chindata raised $621 million through its US initial public offering.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- The specter of crippling labor strikes and rising costs slammed stocks of the two major US automakers, with General Motors Co. notching its worst weekly run in nearly five months and Ford Motor Co. closing at its lowest since early June.Shares of GM and peer Ford nosedived amid a rush of news that heightened fears over surging labor costs. Both car manufacturers are currently in talks with their labor union — United Auto Workers (UAW) — on new contract terms, and a report Tuesday suggested that the demands could end up adding more than $80 billion to each of their labor costs.Investors’ anxiety was also fueled by courier firm Union Parcel Service Inc. lowering its profit outlook for the year on the back of rising costs stemming from its own recent tentative agreement with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.“The recent success of the Teamsters contract negotiations has cast a spotlight on the current environment where Labor has the upper hand over capital in the post lockdown economy,” Arthur Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth, said in an interview.Shares of GM dropped 0.8% on Friday, and fell 7.3% for the week, the biggest such plunge since March 17. Ford declined 5.8% on the week and closed at its lowest since June 1.Investors increasingly worry that unions now have the advantage in contract negotiations, which raises the risk of work stoppages and subsequent production disruptions, in addition to higher costs, analysts and strategists said.“The expiring UAW contract on Sept. 14 is the most imminent risk to GM & Ford,” Wells Fargo analyst Colin Langan wrote in a note. The union’s “audacious demands” raise the risk of a strike, he said, estimating meeting all UAW demands implies wages will rise to about $136 per hour from about $66 per hour.Story continuesShares of GM and Ford have been on a volatile ride this year, but the going got really rough over the past month amid concerns about the slow progress of their electric-vehicle programs, pressure on car prices as inflation cools and growing anxiety over union talks. Those headwinds sent both stocks down at least 15% in the past month.While the selloff may support the view that much of these risks are already priced into the stocks, Matthew Tuttle, chief investment officer at Tuttle Capital Management, warns more declines are possible.“Both stocks are not far from important support at the May highs, and if that breaks then there could be a lot lower to go,” he said.(Updates stock moves in first and fifth paragraphs.)©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- The World Bank arbitration court awarded $77 million to Exxon Mobil Corp. in a resubmitted claim worth $1.4 billion over the nationalization of Venezuela’s Cerro Negro and La Ceiba crude projects in 2007.The award is the result of a long legal battle that ended with the International Center for Settlement of International Disputes deciding July 10 most of the $984.5 million compensation granted to Exxon already had been paid in a separate claim with the International Chamber of Commerce, which resulted in Exxon receiving $907.5 million in 2011.If Exxon wants to receive the full amount it is seeking from Venezuela, it must return what it previously received, according to a copy of the award document seen by Bloomberg.That would leave $76.9 million in favor of the Texas-based firm, plus a little over $1 million to cover part of their legal expenses. The award isn’t public because it requires consent from both parties to be published, an ICSID press official said.Read More: World Bank Court Annuls $1.4 Billion Venezuela-Exxon AwardExxon said it would not comment on details of the award but “on balance, ICSID ruled in our favor,” Todd Spitler, Exxon spokesperson, said in an email.Venezuela’s information ministry did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment.The amount of the initial compensation awarded to Exxon was challenged by the ICSID in 2017 when it partially annulled a previous ruling that ordered Venezuela to pay $1.4 billion. The court stated at the time the compensation was not calculated under applicable law, among other issues. Exxon reintroduced the claim one year later.Story continuesExxon was the first international oil company to abandon Venezuela after the late President Hugo Chávez nationalized oil assets a decade ago.ConocoPhillips, which also filed for arbitration for the seizure of its Hamaca and Petrozuata assets in 2007, could soon see a slice of the proceeds.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- While the cause of the deadly Maui fires remains under investigation, lawyers are sending experts to the island to look into utility power lines as being a possible source of ignition.Attorneys with Watts Guerra, Singleton Schreiber, and Frantz Law Group said they have been collecting evidence, interviewing eyewitnesses and reviewing reports that indicate that damaged power infrastructure owned by Hawaiian Electric Industries Inc. created the spark for the flames.“All evidence — videos, witness accounts, burn progression, and utility equipment remaining — points to Hawaiian Electric’s equipment being the ignition source of the fire that devastated Lahaina,” said Mikal Watts, a Puerto Rico-based plaintiffs lawyer at Watts Guerra who has won millions of dollars in settlements in other wildfire cases, including against California utility giant PG&E Corp.Hawaiian Electric said it doesn’t have information on what caused the fires, according to an email statement from spokesman Darren Pai. “Access to the impacted area is also limited for safety and emergency response concerns,” Pai said. “After the immediate emergency has passed, we will work with the County and others to investigate what happened on Maui.”Officials haven’t said what sparked the blazes that were fanned by hurricane-force winds and leveled the historic town of Lahaina. The investigation into what Hawaii Governor Josh Green described as the state’s largest-ever natural disaster could take weeks or months to produce an official determination of the cause.Emergency workers on Saturday continued to dig through the ash and rubble, with the official death count from the fires rising to 80.Story continuesRead more: 13 Photos Show the Destructive Force of Wildfires in MauiHawaiian Electric, which operates the Maui Electric utility, has come under criticism for not turning off power despite warnings of critical fire conditions due to predicted dry, gale-force winds. The utility earlier this week said strong winds downed electric power lines and snapped power poles ahead of the blazes.That said, many things can spark a fire in the right conditions, including backfiring cars and trucks dragging chains along a road.Michael Wara, a wildfire expert who is director of the Climate and Energy Policy Program at Stanford University, said there is “no question” that the utility should have cut power to reduce wildfire risk with the forecast of gusty winds. The controversial practice is now used by utilities in California, Nevada and Oregon after power lines sparked catastrophic fires during dry windstorms in California.“We had a situation here with very high winds, very high heat,” said James Frantz, whose firm, Frantz Law Group, is looking at power lines as a culprit and has been signing up residents and businesses in Maui who lost their homes. “And all those factors call for de-energizing those lines when that event occurs. They did not do that and they had the power to do it.”Frantz Law Group has an office in Honolulu and is working with a local law firm on the investigation.Read More: Jeff Bezos, Lauren Sanchez to Give $100 Million to Maui FundHawaii Electric doesn’t have a formal power shutoff program for fire risk, Pai said.“Preemptive, short-notice power shutoffs have to be coordinated with first responders and in Lahaina, electricity powers the pumps that provide the water needed for firefighting,” Pai said. The utility has a “robust wildfire mitigation and grid resiliency program that includes vegetation management, grid hardening investments and regular inspection of our assets,” he added.The blaze that razed Lahaina damaged or destroyed 2,207 structures, the majority of them residential, with an estimated capital cost of approximately $5.5 billion, according to a damage assessment released Saturday by the Pacific Disaster Center and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.Plaintiff lawyers often dispatch representatives of their offices to sign up clients in the wake of wildfire disasters. The plaintiff law firms now working in Maui represented fire victims in a $13.5 billion settlement with PG&E, which was driven into bankruptcy in 2019 after its utility equipment sparked some of the deadliest wildfires in California history.Witness AccountsAttorney Gerald Singleton said his group, Singleton Schreiber, was flying investigators to Maui this weekend to look into witness accounts of falling power lines and then fires starting, although an actual cause has yet to be determined.“This wasn’t something they couldn’t have predicted,” Singleton said of the high winds taking down lines. “It’s hard to understand why more precautions weren’t taken.”If there is a link to power lines, Hawaiian Electric will have to be shown to be negligent or that it could have reasonably prevented a loss, a higher legal standard than the one applied to utilities in California, according to a note Friday by Guggenheim Securities. The New York-based investment research firm downgraded Hawaiian Electric’s stock to $32 from $35 based on the fire exposure risk.Investor worries about Hawaiian Electric’s potential role in starting the blazes triggered a selloff of the company’s stock on Thursday, when it tumbled the most in more than two years. Shares fell again on Friday, dropping 1.2%, to close at $32.40. The company’s market capitalization is $3.5 billion.“With forest fires and utilities these days you can’t blame investors for selling first and asking questions later,” said Andy DeVries, a utility analyst for CreditSights.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Source: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/russia-oil-breaches-price-cap-101932355.html
Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Russia’s crude breached the price cap set by the Group of Seven nations, while revenue from oil exports soared to an eight-month high, according to the International Energy Agency.The price of the country’s seaborne crude shipments last month jumped to $64.41 a barrel on a weighted average, “smashing” the $60 price limit set last year by the G-7, the IEA said in latest monthly report.Read more: Russian Flagship Oil Breaches Price Cap in Blow to SanctionsThe Western alliance imposed the cap to simultaneously limit the stream of petrodollars to Moscow amid the war in Ukraine and keep Russian oil flowing to global markets. Since Russia is one of the world’s top producers, too-severe restrictions risked causing a broader spike in prices.While the US-led effort has so far avoided that threat of an unintentional spike, the surge in oil revenue to an eight-month high exposes how successful Russia and its allies have been restructuring the market to partly avoid the limits and capture price increases for oil transported outside the cap program.Under the cap system, companies can move Russian oil only if they pay less than the threshold price — or else lose access to key services like insurance.The effect has been a complete redrawing of the global crude trade, with Moscow finding buyers mainly in India and China to fill the gap as Europe shuns Russian oil. Russia has relied heavily on a shadow fleet of aging tankers as it continues to find a market for its crude. Those transactions helped move the average price of Russian oil trades above the $60 cap.With Russian grades now trading above the G-7 allowed price, the chances of accidentally pushing prices higher might be increasing. If shippers and insurers grow cautious of taking Russian cargoes that may be above the limit, that risks further tightening supplies and potentially driving global prices higher.Story continuesIn a statement, Treasury Department spokeswoman Megan Apper said the price cap is working and noted that sales above $60 aren’t a violation of the cap if they don’t use Group of Seven coalition services.“Russian oil revenue is down nearly 50% from a year prior,” Apper said. “Any money Russia spends to create an ecosystem outside of the price cap takes resources away from its ability to fund its barbaric war.”Apper pointed to an Aug. 3 speech in London by Eric Van Nostrand, the acting assistant secretary for economic policy, who similarly dismissed anxiety around prices rising above the level of the cap and said the cap is still limiting Russian revenues.The price strength of Russia’s Urals crude reflects supply tensions for sour grades amid supply cuts within the OPEC+ oil alliance, the IEA said. Russia is also seeing an increase in demand from its refineries following seasonal maintenance. Export curbs by the country should continue to support prices, according to the agency.In exceeding the price limit, Moscow has bolstered its oil revenue, a key source of funding amid the rising cost of its war efforts. Russia earned $15.3 billion from exports of its crude and fuel in July, up by almost 20% from previous month, according to the IEA. Still, the country’s oil revenues were down by more than a fifth from a year earlier.In response to Western sanctions, Russia pledged to curb crude production by 500,000 barrels a day, using February output as a baseline, though there was scant evidence of adherence to this commitment earlier this year. However, Moscow “more than fulfilled” this voluntary cut in July, the IEA said. Russia has also vowed to curb crude exports in August by 500,000 barrels a day, continuing those reductions at a tapered level in September.Russia’s oil exports remained steady in July at 7.3 million barrels a day after declining in June on a monthly basis, according to the IEA. Higher shipments of fuels helped offset lower loadings of crude, the agency said.Read more: Russia Raises July Oil Processing as Major Maintenance is Over--With assistance from Christopher Condon.(Updates with Treasury comment from eighth paragraph.)©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Spokesperson Trunoyudo Wisnu Andiko said on Tuesday the report would be investigated.Capella said in a statement on Instagram she does not condone any form of sexual harassment."I emphasise that I, as the national director and license owner for Miss Universe Indonesia, was not involved at all and have never known, ordered, requested or allowed anyone who plays a role and participated in the process of organising Miss Universe Indonesia 2023 to commit sexual harassment through body checking as reported," she said.The Jakarta contest was held to select Indonesia's entry for the annual Miss Universe competition, to be held in El Salvador late this year.The Miss Universe Organization said it was evaluating its policies and procedures to avoid similar occurrence in the future, adding that there are no measurement or body dimensions requirement to join their pageant worldwide.(Reporting by Fransiska Nangoy and Stanley Widianto; Editing by William Mallard)

Text Content: DAKAR, Aug 12 (Reuters) - West African leaders were weighing their next moves on Saturday as they seek to overturn a military coup in Niger that has rocked the region but also triggered a groundswell of support in the country.Niger's military last month imprisoned President Mohamed Bazoum and assumed power, drawing condemnation from international powers and raising the spectre of further conflict in the impoverished Sahel region of West Africa which is already overrun by a deadly Islamist insurgency.The regional bloc ECOWAS on Thursday decided to activate a task force drawing on troops from across the region for a possible military intervention to undo what was the seventh coup in West and Central Africa in three years.At stake is not just the fate of Niger - a major uranium producer and key Western ally in the fight against the Islamists - but also the concerns of global powers with key strategic interests in the semi-desert zone.U.S., French, German and Italian troops are stationed in Niger to repel local affiliates of al Qaeda and Islamic State that have killed thousands and displaced millions across the Sahel.Western powers fear Russian influence could grow stronger if the junta in Niger follows Mali's example by ejecting Western troops and inviting in mercenaries from Russia's Wagner Group.Thousands of people gathered in Niger's capital on Friday to demonstrate in favour of the coup. The rally began at a French military base in the capital Niamey, then protesters with signs and flags spread onto surrounding streets."Long live Russia," one protester's sign read. "Down with France.... Down with ECOWAS," referring to the Economic Community of West African States.Regional army chiefs were set to meet in the coming days. It was not yet clear how long the ECOWAS force would take to assemble, how big it would be and if it would actually invade. The organisation stressed that all options were on the table and it hoped for a peaceful resolution.Story continuesSecurity analysts said the force could take weeks to set up, potentially leaving room for negotiations.Meanwhile, the African Union, the European Union, the United States and the United Nations all said they were increasingly worried about Bazoum's detention conditions.The U.N. Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk on Friday said the conditions were "rapidly deteriorating" and could amount to a violation of international human rights law.

Text Content: (Updates with arrival in New York, changes dateline, adds bylines)By Jennah Moon and Ben BlanchardNEW YORK, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Taiwan Vice President William Lai arrived in New York on Saturday at the start of a sensitive U.S. stopover, which China has condemned and Taiwanese officials fear could prompt more Chinese military activity around the democratically governed island.Lai, the front-runner to become Taiwan's president in elections in January, is officially making only transit stops in the United States on his way to and from Paraguay for the swearing in of its president next week.The China Airlines flight Lai took from Taipei landed at New York's John F. Kennedy Airport shortly after 8:15 p.m. local time (0015 GMT), according to flight tracking app Flightradar24.Neither Taiwan nor the United States has given exact details about his U.S. schedule, which both are aiming to keep low key, according to officials briefed on the trip.Taipei and Washington call U.S. stopovers by Taiwanese officials routine and no cause for China to take "provocative" actions, but Beijing has reacted with anger at what it sees as a further sign of U.S. support for Taiwan, which it claims as its own.China is likely to launch military drills next week near Taiwan, using Lai's U.S. stopovers as a pretext to intimidate voters ahead of a next year's election and make them "fear war," Taiwanese officials say.Lai, speaking to reporters before leaving Taiwan, made only fleeting mention of the U.S. part of his trip, simply noting he was going to New York first.Lai's U.S. stopover will be the 11th by a Taiwanese vice president, according to the State Department, which calls them routine but "private and unofficial."Washington does not have formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan, but is its most important international source of weapons, and the island’s contested status is a constant source of friction with Beijing.Story continuesParaguay is one of the few remaining countries in the world that retains formal ties with Taiwan.Lai has made one prior U.S. transit as Taiwan’s vice president, in January 2022 on a trip to Honduras, a then-ally of the island that switched its diplomatic recognition to Beijing in early 2023.Lai said he would use the Paraguay visit not only to deepen ties with that country but also to have "self-confident" exchanges with other countries and meet with delegations from like-minded partners. He did not say who.This would "let the international community understand that Taiwan is a country that adheres to democracy, freedom and human rights, and actively participates in international affairs," Lai added.Lai went to Honduras last year for the inauguration of its president and had a brief though symbolic chat there with U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris. The United States has not announced who may be going to Paraguay next week.Three sources told Reuters the Biden administration was eager to keep Lai’s visit low-profile so as not to stoke tensions before Taiwan's election and to preserve the recent momentum in U.S. engagements with senior Chinese officials.That includes the prospect of a visit to the U.S. by China’s foreign minister Wang Yi, which could pave the way for a meeting between U.S. President Joe Biden and China’s leader Xi Jinping this year.Beijing particularly dislikes Lai, who has in the past described himself as a "practical worker for Taiwan independence". Lai has repeatedly said during the election campaign he does not seek to change the status quo.Before leaving, Lai wrote in English on social media platform X, formerly called Twitter, that he was "excited to meet with US friends in transit" and to be going to Paraguay, one of just 13 countries to maintain formal ties with Taipei.Laura Rosenberger, chair of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), a U.S. government-run non-profit that carries out unofficial relations with Taiwan, responded on X that AIT was looking forward to welcoming him "during his transit en route to Paraguay".Lai is to return from Paraguay via San Francisco and is due back in Taiwan on Friday, according to the official schedule for the trip published on Saturday, which did not mention the U.S. legs.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- A renewed slide in tech megacaps and mixed economic data left stocks struggling for direction on Friday. Bond yields rose.In a choppy trading session, the S&P 500 closed at a one-month low with a drop of just 0.1%. The Nasdaq 100 notched its longest weekly losing streak this year, hovering around 15,000. It last finished below that mark in June. Nvidia Corp. — which has more than tripled in 2023 — extended a four-day decline to 10%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average posted a mild gain.There’s little question stocks have lost a lot of their upside momentum, according to Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co.“As we move closer to the usually volatile September/October time frame, it does seem like the ‘dippers’ are losing some of their strength,” Maley noted. “This does not mean that the stock market will roll over in a serious manner over the next month or two, but it does raise the odds of a correction in the not-too-distant future.”Earlier Friday, the S&P 500 traded within a whisker of its 50-day moving average. A breach of that threshold could portend further losses, according to some technical analysts.Still, with equities pressing moderately toward oversold territory on a short-term basis, the path lower wouldn’t be a straight one, according to Dan Wantrobski at Janney Montgomery Scott.That means stocks are soon poised to attempt “another oversold rally effort,” he noted.Equity Risk PremiumBill Gross, the one-time bond king, said stock and Treasury bulls are wrong as both markets are “overvalued.”The former chief investment officer of Pacific Investment Management Co. told Bloomberg Television that the fair value of the 10-year Treasury yield is about 4.5%, compared with the current level of 4.15%.Story continuesEarly this month, a key market indicator that has been described as possibly the “most important number in finance” sank to its lowest since 2004, worrying investors that it was sending a bearish signal. Yet, history shows that despite the extreme move, the typically ominous sign is instead pointing to more gains.The plunge in the equity risk premium — which measures the difference between the earnings yield on the S&P 500 and the current rate on 10-year Treasury notes — signals stocks are getting overvalued relative to bonds. But a Bloomberg Intelligence analysis found the gauge is now at a level where returns for the S&P 500 historically averaged in high single digits over a 12-month horizon.Treasuries are on course for a record year of inflows as investors chasing some of the highest yields in months pile into cash and bonds, according to Bank of America Corp. strategists led by Michael Hartnett.Cash funds attracted $20.5 billion and investors poured $6.9 billion into bonds in the week through August 9, they wrote in a note, citing data from EPFR Global. US stocks had their first outflow in three weeks at $1.6 billion.Meantime, Friday’s economic reports did little to alter swap market bets that the Federal Reserve will pause its rate hikes next month. Traders also continued to expect the central bank to signal its battle against inflation isn’t over yet.Consumer inflation expectations as measured by the University of Michigan unexpectedly fell in early August, despite higher gasoline and grocery costs. Meantime, producer prices grew last month by more than expected, primarily due to increases in certain service categories.Elsewhere, UK bond yields climbed on data showing the British economy delivered its strongest quarterly growth in more than a year, a surprising show of resilience that will keep pressure on the Bank of England to raise rates further.Oil posted its longest streak of weekly gains since mid-2022 as multiple reports forecasting increased demand gave a fresh boost to a rally built on increased supply-disruption risks and extended Saudi production cuts.Some of the main moves in markets:StocksCurrenciesCryptocurrenciesBondsCommoditiesThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.--With assistance from Rob Verdonck, Richard Henderson, Alex Nicholson and Cecile Gutscher.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: By Nicolás MisculinBUENOS AIRES, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Argentines head to the polls on Sunday in primary elections, with voters set to punish the ruling center-left Peronist coalition, angry at inflation scraping 116% and a cost of living crisis that has left four in 10 people in poverty.The primary is obligatory for most adults and each person gets one vote, making it in effect a giant dress rehearsal of the general election in October and giving a clear indication of who is the favorite to take the presidency.That will be key for policy affecting Argentina's huge farm sector, one of the world's top exporters of soy, corn and beef, the peso currency and bonds, and ongoing talks over a wobbling $44 billion debt deal with the International Monetary Fund.Polls will open at 8 a.m. (1100 GMT) and voting centers will close at around 6 p.m. (2100 GMT), with the first results expected around 9 p.m. (0000 GMT).The economic crisis has left many disillusioned with the main political parties, the ruling Peronist coalition and the conservative opposition Together for Change, and opened the door for a potential surprise win by a far-right libertarian candidate.Others are planning a protest vote for fringe parties or none at all, a trend which could play against the more moderate candidates in the race, including conservative Buenos Aires Mayor Horacio Larreta or Economy Minister Sergio Massa."I am thinking of leaving my vote blank," said Micaela Panzera, a 22-year-old employee of a food company in Buenos Aires. "No candidate really convinces me."The most important leadership race is in the conservative Together for Change coalition, between centrist Larreta and more hard-line rival, ex-security minister Patricia Bullrich. Both are pledging more austerity and freer markets.A major X factor is libertarian economist Javier Milei, who has been getting nearly one-fifth of the likely vote in opinion polls and winning over voters with a brash, unapologetic style. He wants to dollarize the economy and shut the central bank.Story continues"A strong performance by the libertarian candidate would also constitute a surprise and could point to a contested three-candidate race in October," bank Goldman Sachs said in a note.Pollsters expect low turnout, despite a fine for not voting."Higher abstention should be expected, perhaps also more blank votes. We have seen warning signs of this in the provincial elections held up to now," said political analyst Carlos Fara."The hardest element to predict is Milei's performance, because he's a phenomenon outside the political norm."Pollsters see the combined Together for Change opposition candidates just ahead of the ruling Peronist bloc, with Milei pulling close to 20%. Many, however, admit it's a hard race to predict. In the 2019 primary the polls were proved badly wrong.Whoever wins in October - or more likely in a November runoff - will have major decisions to make on rebuilding depleted foreign reserves, boosting grains exports, reining in inflation and on how to unwind a thicket of currency controls.(Reporting by Nicolás Misculin; Additional reporting by Candelaria Grimberg; Editing by Adam Jourdan and Jonathan Oatis)

Text Content: (Adds annual inflation, background on Venezuela economy)CARACAS, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Venezuela's inflation rate hit 6.2% in July, the same level as the prior month, according to central bank data published on Friday.Inflation for the first seven months of the year stood at 121.3%.The biggest price hikes were seen in the services sector at 10.5%, followed by communications, with a 8.1% surge.Meanwhile, annual inflation slowed to 398.1%, according to Reuters calculations based on official figures, from 404.3% the previous month, retaining its position as the region's highest.President Nicolas Maduro's government has tried to curb inflation with rigid economic policies, including cuts in public spending, restrictions on credit, and foreign currency injections to stabilize its local coin.The strategy has struggled to bend inflation's upward trajectory and Venezuela's bolivar has depreciated more against the U.S. dollar, currently trading at around 30 bolivars per dollar.Government spending has also sped up, with demand for dollars outpacing the central bank's foreign currency reserves.

Text Content: (Reuters) -Electric-truck maker Nikola said on Friday it was recalling about 209 battery-powered electric trucks and suspending sales after an investigation into recent fires found a coolant leak inside a battery pack as the cause.The preliminary findings of the probe by a third-party investigator were corroborated on Thursday by a "minor thermal incident" on one pack on a parked engineering-validation truck, the company said, adding that no one was injured."Foul play or other external factors were unlikely to have caused the incident," Nikola said in a statement, adding efforts were underway to provide a remedy.The company had said it suspected foul play when it started an investigation in June after trucks at its Phoenix, Arizona, headquarters caught fire. One damaged truck, kept at the Phoenix site for monitoring, reignited last month.Internal investigations from Nikola's safety and engineering teams indicate a single supplier component within the battery pack as the likely source of the coolant leak that caused the vehicles to catch fire, the company said.Struggling with supply chain bottlenecks and weaker demand, Nikola decided to make battery electric trucks only to order and focus on hydrogen fuel cell trucks.Nikola on Aug. 4 appointed Chairman Stephen Girsky, a former General Motors executive, as its chief executive, its fourth in four years.The company flagged "substantial doubts" about its ability to continue as a going concern for the next 12 months, reiterating its warning for the third time since February, as it awaits "critical" additional capital.On Friday, Nikola asked customers and dealers of its Tre battery electric trucks to take certain immediate safety measures, including considering parking them outside.Nikola's shares fell as much as 5.6% after the close.(Reporting by Shubhendu Deshmukh and Mrinmay Dey in Bengaluru and Abhirup Roy in San Francisco; Editing by Sandra Maler and William Mallard)

Text Content: By David Shepardson(Reuters) -The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and National Transportation Safety Board said on Saturday they were investigating a near collision between a Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 and a Cessna Citation 560X business jet in San Diego, the latest in a series of troubling U.S. aviation incidents.The FAA said its preliminary review shows that just before 12 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time (1900 GMT) on Friday, an air traffic controller at San Diego International Airport cleared the Cessna to land on a certain runway even though Southwest Airlines Flight 2493 had already been told to taxi onto the same runway and await instructions to depart.The facility’s automated surface surveillance system alerted the controller about the developing situation and the controller directed the Cessna to discontinue landing.A person briefed on the matter said the initial review shows the Cessna passed over the top of the Southwest airplane by about 100 feet. The FAA is sending a team to the facility to investigate.Southwest said on Saturday it is participating in the FAA’s review of the incident. "Our aircraft departed without event and the flight operated normally, with a safe landing in San Jose as scheduled," the airline said.The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating seven runway incursion events since January, including Friday's San Diego incident.A similar near-collision incident occurred in February in Austin, Texas, when a FedEx cargo plane and a Southwest Boeing 737 came within about 115 feet (35 meters) in poor visibility conditions. The controller had cleared the FedEx plane to land and the Southwest plane to depart.On Thursday, the NTSB cited the failure of a Lear 60 charter pilot to get a takeoff clearance in a February incident in Boston that resulted in a near-collision with a JetBlue flight.The NTSB said the airport surface detection equipment issued an alert, and the air traffic controller gave go-around instructions to the JetBlue flight.Story continuesThe JetBlue Embraer 190 was just 30 feet (9.1 m) above ground when it broke off the landing "close to the point where both runways intersected," the NTSB said, adding the Boston tower told the charter pilot the JetBlue flight passed about 400 feet above them.In March, the FAA said it was taking steps to improve its air traffic control operations after near-miss incidents telling employees: "There is no question that we are seeing too many close calls."The FAA held a safety summit and issued a separate safety alert in March to airlines, pilots and others citing the "need for continued vigilance and attention to mitigation of safety risks."(Reporting by David Shepardson in WashingtonEditing by Andrew Heavens, Matthew Lewis and Raju Gopalakrishnan)

Text Content: SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) — Douglas Guzmán's TikTok feed was dotted with workout routines and videos showcasing his favorite parts of his country.That changed about a year ago, as rights groups, civil society and even some officials criticized El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele for violating human rights in his crackdown on criminal gangs, and said that his unconstitutional bid for re-election would corrode the country’s democracy.Within days of Bukele announcing his bid for a second five-year term, Guzmán’s feed was plastered with videos describing Bukele as the “future liberator of Latin America” and slick montages of the leader’s “mega-prison” for accused gangsters.Views on the social media influencer’s videos skyrocketed. The 39-year-old member of Bukele's party said he found a new mission: counteracting negative press from independent media about his populist president.“(Journalists) don’t know anything. All they do is sit at their desks and watch as President Bukele … makes a massive effort to save thousands of lives. But they don’t see that because they’ve never cared about the lives of Salvadorans,” Guzmán said. “That’s why we’re here. To show the true reality.”Guzmán is part of an expanding network of social media personalities acting as a megaphone for the millennial leader. At the same time Bukele has cracked down on the press, his government has embraced those influencers. As the president seeks to hold onto power, he has harnessed that flood of pro-Bukele content slowly turning his Central American nation into an informational echo chamber.“A news organization doing an investigation can’t compare to the sounding board that these influencers have because they flood your social media with the government’s narrative,” said Roberto Dubon, a communications strategist and congressional candidate for Bukele’s former party, FMLN. “What you have is an apparatus to spread their propaganda.”Bukele, a 42-year-old leader often donning a backwards baseball cap, worked years in political advertising before social media became a key to his rise to power five years ago. Since, his approval ratings have soared to 90%, according to a June CID Gallup poll. Bukele's modern political messaging, charisma and brutal crackdown on the country's gangs only continue to win him fans domestically and abroad even in the midst of controversy.Story continuesBy doing so, Bukele is using a playbook increasingly utilized by 21st century autocrats, said Seva Gunitsky, a political scientist at the University of Toronto.Social media was once hailed as the ultimate democratic tool to organize protests, even revolutions, across the world. Now, governments from Russia to Uganda are now using it to control the narrative.“They use this tool of liberation technology to actually prolong and strengthen their rule,” Gunitsky said. Such governments use influencers because their content “doesn’t look as much like propaganda and is more about shaping the narrative in more subtle ways.”Under Bukele, El Salvador constructed a sophisticated communications machine. It locked down access to information out of line with official messaging and hired teams of former journalists to produce blockbuster-quality videos showcasing security forces taking on the nation’s gangs. The government also mimicked Russia, building an army of tech-savvy contractors – or “trolls” – to create fake social media accounts, spread falsities and harass critics.At the same time his message of a strong-handed response to gang violence rippled across the region, gaining traction in other nations struggling with crime across Latin America and Caribbean.With it, an “entire industry” has been born as influencers latch onto the president's image, said Oscar Picardo, director of investigations at El Salvador’s Universidad Francisco Gavidia.A study by Picardo's university and local investigative outlet Factum examined 69 pro-Bukele YouTube accounts, which collectively have more followers than the population of El Salvador. They found many accounts – which make money through view and subscriber counts – can earn up to tens of thousands of dollars a month, far greater than El Salvador's average salary. That content is devoured both within El Salvador, and by many of the 2.3 million Salvadorans living in the United States.The cluster of accounts pumped out nearly 32 hours of pro-Bukele content in a single day in May, the study found. Almost always mirroring government language, 90% of the videos analyzed contained false or misleading information.One account, Noticias Cuscatlecas, may earn much as $400,000 annually posting videos of violent attacks from alleged gang members layered over chilling music, UFG and Factum calculated.The channel often concludes videos with the same message: “(Bukele) devised a plan to exterminate this cancer from society, and the incredible thing is that he is succeeding. Now the people no longer live in fear."On TikTok, one video declares “God chose Bukele as president of El Salvador.” On YouTube, personalities dressed as TV anchors attack human rights groups and journalists. They feature Bukele’s critics bursting into flames while claiming their channel “brings you the latest news”. Others sit down for an exclusive interview with the president.In April, the president of El Salvador's congress Ernesto Castro announced he was opening the assembly to YouTubers and social media influencers to “inform with objectivity.”“The right to inform and be informed is a power not just in the hands of media companies,” Castro wrote on Twitter.Requests by the AP for interviews with Bukele and his cabinet throughout his more than four years in office have been declined or ignored. Two people with knowledge of the inner workings of Bukele’s media machine declined to speak to the AP out of fear of the government.For Guzmán and others, the access was empowering, enabling them to grow their audiences. Since, Guzmán has been offered access to other large events like the inauguration of Central American and Caribbean Games, something experts say Bukele used to show a friendly face to the world.Press credentials hung around the TikToker's neck and he brimmed with pride in a government press box, standing among other selfie stick-wielding influencers.“Us being here, accredited, I feel like I am a part of this,” Guzmán said, eyes crinkling with a broad smile.Around him, others took turns interviewing each other and bragged about how many people were connected to their feeds. One man wearing a Hawaiian shirt leapt over rows of bleachers to get a better signal. When Bukele walked on stage to give a speech, Guzmán and others chanted “Re-election!”El Salvador's government is not the first to open its doors to social media personalities, but researchers and critics says the atmosphere created in El Salvador marks a particular risk as other leaders in the region seek to mimic Bukele.Picardo, the UFG investigator, said such accounts post a deluge of content when the government is trying to publicize something, like the leader's experiment with Bitcoin, its gang crackdown or the Games.The researcher warned their increasingly hostile tone acts as a harbinger for further deteriorating press freedoms, echoing State Department alarms of a “villainization” of journalists by Bukele.Oscar Martínez's award-winning news organization El Faro is among those facing attacks and harassment for its intensive investigation of Bukele, including audio evidencing that Bukele’s administration negotiated with gangs in order to dip violence.The government opened a case against El Faro for tax evasion, something the news site called “ completely baseless.” Phones of dozens of journalists were hacked with Pegasus spyware, regularly used by governments to spy on opponents.In April, El Faro announced it would move its center of operations to Costa Rica due to escalating harassment.He worries their investigations is being drowned out by the flood of disinformation, and said if Bukele stays in power in the upcoming elections, it will put reporters in El Salvador “much more at risk.”“At that moment, Bukele is going to decide to get rid of any obstacle he has within the country, and the main obstacle he has right now is the free press," Martínez said.

Text Content: TAIPEI, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Taiwan Vice President William Lai leaves on Saturday for a sensitive trip to the United States, which China has condemned and Taiwanese officials fear could prompt more Chinese military activity around the democratically governed island.Lai, the front-runner to become Taiwan's president in elections in January, is officially making only transit stops in the United States on his way to and from Paraguay for the swearing in of its president.Taipei and Washington say such stopovers are routine and no cause for China to take "provocative" actions, but Beijing has reacted with anger at what it sees as a further sign of U.S. support for Taiwan, which it claims as sovereign Chinese territory.China is likely to launch military drills next week near Taiwan, using Lai's stopovers in the United States as a pretext to intimidate voters ahead of a next year's election and make them "fear war", Taiwanese officials say.Beijing particularly dislikes Lai, who has in the past described himself as a "practical worker for Taiwan independence". Lai has, however, repeatedly said during the election campaign he does not seek to change the status quo.Lai, who goes first to New York, published a short video on his social media accounts late on Friday about his trip, mentioning only the Paraguay part, the country being one of just 13 to maintain formal ties with Taipei.He showed off what he will be taking with him, including the gift of a Garmin solar-powered GPS bike computer for Paraguay's new president, Santiago Pena, as well as neck cushions and baggage tags emblazoned with words including "Team Taiwan" in English and "Taiwan, your backer" in Chinese."I hope, by serving as President Tsai Ing-wen's special envoy to Paraguay to participate in the inauguration ceremony of the new president, to convey the blessings of the people of Taiwan," he said.Story continuesNeither Taiwan nor the United States have given exact details about his U.S. schedule.The U.S. State Department told Reuters that, consistent with past transits, Lai would meet the chair of the Virginia-based American Institute in Taiwan, a U.S. government-run non-profit that carries out unofficial relations with Taiwan.Lai, scheduled to speak to reporters at Taiwan's main international airport on Saturday afternoon before leaving, is to return from Paraguay via San Francisco.The Paraguay leg of the trip is also important given China's increasing efforts to take Taiwan's remaining allies.Honduras, once a stalwart Taiwanese partner, switched relations to China in March. Lai went to Honduras last year for the inauguration of its president and had a brief though symbolic chat while there with U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris.(Reporting by Ben Blanchard; Editing by William Mallard)

Source: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hes-just-ken-barbie-movie-130653159.html
Text Content: NEW YORK (AP) — On and off the big screen, it's Barbie's world and Ken is just living in it.As reflected in Greta Gerwig's blockbuster movie that tackles the legacy Mattel's famous doll, Barbie has always been more popular than Ken. For every Ken doll sold today, there’s generally eight to 10 Barbies sold, according to Jim Silver, a toy industry expert and CEO of review site of TTPM.It's unclear if Warner Bros' “Barbie,” which was also co-produced by Mattel, will increase Ken production and sales. But Silver noted that the movie “gave Ken more attention than Ken has received" in decades.Ken was first introduced back in 1961, two years after Barbie hit store shelves. But he hasn't had nearly the same impact on the Barbieverse since.“Barbie’s world is about Barbie. And (to some), Ken may be an accessory of sorts," said Ed Timke, an assistant professor of advertising and public relations at Michigan State University, pointing to years of marketing that has, naturally, put Barbie at center stage.The new attention around Ken following “Barbie’s” release has also received pushback. Many note that the movie is about Barbie — not Ken — and that's where the spotlight should stay.Still, the dynamic between the film’s Barbie and Ken may get people to reflect some big questions about gender as well as Ken's own evolution over the years.Who is Ken as a toy and how has he changed?Ken's relationship to Barbie has been up for debate since the two hit the toy aisle together. While Mattel long-advertised Ken as Barbie's boyfriend — and even detailed their 2004 split and subsequent reconciliation seven years later — many also saw Ken as Barbie's best friend, and sometimes queer icon. One 1993 version of Ken in particular, Earring Magic Ken, became notably popular among LGBTQ consumers, the New York Historical Society notes. At the time, Mattel denied the Earring Magic Ken was queer and later pulled him from shelves.Story continuesOther popular versions of Ken ranged from the tuxedo-wearing 1984 Dream Date Ken, to 1978 Superstar Ken and 1979 Sun Malibu Ken, which became one of the doll's most iconic looks (as reflected in Ryan Gosling's character). While Ken has gone through far fewer career changes than Barbie, his resume boasts job titles like astronaut, barista, country western singer and doctor.“A wonderful thing is that through play, children are free to have their dolls take on any type of role that they wish,” said Ann Herzog, a clinical instructor of child life and family-centered care at Boston University.She also underlined the importance of diversity in toy collections and providing “open-ended play opportunities and not to endorse stereotypes that the Barbie collection and dolls in general are only specific to a particular gender.”While children of all genders, including young boys, have played with Barbie and Ken over the years, Timke notes that “there’s definitely the gendering of marketing toward girls” for both figures, pointing to contrasts in advertising for products historically seen as “boy toys,” such as G.I. Joe. That legacy, as well as other socialization, still impacts who plays with certain toys today.Still, Ken — like Barbie — has evolved over time and become more diverse, particularly after Mattel rolled out more skin tones, body types, hairstyles and more for Ken dolls in 2017. Some Kens also have prosthetic legs, wheelchairs and hearing aids. Increases in diverse representation — with similar changes seen since 2016 for Barbie — has boosted the dolls' popularity and comeback sales, Silver said.Will Barbie (and Ken) sales increase following the movie’s release?Mattel did not respond to The Associated Press' requests for data or comment on specific Ken and Barbie sales seen before and after “Barbie's” July 21 release. But according to market research firm Circana, Barbie sales overall for the U.S. toy industry increased 40% in the last two weeks of July compared with the same period in 2022.Circana doesn't break out Ken from Barbie sales. Still, “I suspect that, with the movie, sales of Ken dolls will experience a strong lift in sales," Juli Lennett, VP, U.S. toys industry advisor at Circana, wrote in an email to The Associated Press. Additional experts also expected a spike in interest, but weren't sure about the long run.Lennett did note that the top-selling “Barbie” movie item for those last two weeks of July was the Barbie Gingham Dress followed by the Ken Doll Set. Between those two items, Barbie outsold Ken nearly two to one, she said.For the second quarter of 2023, which ended weeks before the movie’s release, worldwide sales of Barbie to retailers excluding adjustments actually fell 6%. Mattel executives told analysts that sales had improved in July, and it expects the movie will have a halo effect on the brand for years to come.There was a carryover of inventory across the toy industry for the first half of the year, Silver explains, noting that record sales in the first years of the pandemic led to over-buying at the end of 2022. He predicts a rebound in Barbie sales heading into the holiday season, when toy spending is high and after “Barbie” eventually makes its way to streaming.And of course, sales following “Barbie’s” release won’t be limited to the toy aisle. Other branded products are also gaining popularity from the film, including Ken-focused swag like “I am Kenough” sweatshirts and other “Ken-ergy” apparel, are currently for sale by Mattel, as well as from third-party sellers on sites like Amazon and Walmart.

Text Content: By Blake Brittain(Reuters) - Universal Music Group, Sony Music Entertainment and other record labels on Friday sued the nonprofit Internet Archive for copyright infringement over its streaming collection of digitized music from vintage records.The labels' lawsuit filed in a federal court in Manhattan said the Archive's "Great 78 Project" functions as an "illegal record store" for songs by musicians including Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald, Miles Davis and Billie Holiday.They named 2,749 sound-recording copyrights that the Archive allegedly infringed. The labels said their damages in the case could be as high as $412 million.Representatives for the Internet Archive did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the complaint.The San Francisco-based Internet Archive digitally archives websites, books, audio recordings and other materials. It compares itself to a library and says its mission is to "provide universal access to all knowledge."The Internet Archive is already facing another federal lawsuit in Manhattan from leading book publishers who said its digital-book lending program launched in the pandemic violates their copyrights. A judge ruled for the publishers in March, in a decision that the Archive plans to appeal.The Great 78 Project encourages donations of 78-rpm records -- the dominant record format from the early 1900s until the 1950s -- for the group to digitize to "ensure the survival of these cultural materials for future generations to study and enjoy." Its website says the collection includes more than 400,000 recordings.The labels' lawsuit said the project includes thousands of their copyright-protected recordings, including Bing Crosby's "White Christmas," Chuck Berry's "Roll Over Beethoven" and Duke Ellington's "It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)".The lawsuit said the recordings are all available on authorized streaming services and "face no danger of being lost, forgotten, or destroyed."(Reporting by Blake Brittain in Washington; Editing by David Bario and Diane Craft)

Text Content: (Updates with death toll in headline and first paragraph)By Mike Blake and Marco GarciaKAHULUI, Hawaii, Aug 12 (Reuters) - The death toll from the Maui wildfires in Hawaii reached 93 on Saturday, according to the Maui County website, making it the deadliest U.S. wildfire in more than a century, with the total likely to rise as cadaver dogs sift through the ruins of Lahaina.The scale of the damage came into sharper focus four days after a fast-moving blaze leveled the historic resort town, obliterating buildings and melting cars.The cost to rebuild Lahaina was estimated at $5.5 billion, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), with more than 2,200 structures damaged or destroyed and more than 2,100 acres (850 hectares) burned.Hawaii Governor Josh Green warned at a press conference on Saturday afternoon the death toll would continue to increase as more victims were discovered. Dogs trained to detect bodies have covered only 3% of the search area, Maui County Police Chief John Pelletier said.Officials vowed to examine the state's emergency notification systems after some residents questioned whether more could have been done to warn them before the fire overtook their homes. Some were forced to wade into the Pacific Ocean to escape.Sirens stationed around the island - intended to warn of impending natural disasters - never sounded, and widespread power and cellular outages hampered other forms of alerts.The state's attorney general, Anne Lopez, said she was launching a review of the decision-making before and during the fire, while Green told CNN he had authorized a review of the emergency response.Officials have described a nightmarish confluence of factors - including communications network failures, wind gusts of up to 80 miles per hour (130 kph) from an offshore hurricane and a separate wildfire dozens of miles away - that made it nearly impossible to coordinate in real time with the emergency management agency that would typically issue warnings and evacuation orders.Story continues"Over time, we'll be able to figure out if we could have better protected people," said Green. He said the multiple fires and dangerous winds created extraordinarily difficult conditions.The death toll made the inferno, which erupted on Tuesday, Hawaii's worst natural disaster, surpassing a tsunami that killed 61 people in 1960, a year after Hawaii became a U.S. state.The latest figure exceeded the 85 people who perished in a 2018 fire in the town of Paradise, California, and was the highest toll from a wildfire since 1918, when the Cloquet fire in Minnesota and Wisconsin claimed 453 lives.Officials have secured 1,000 hotel rooms for people who lost their homes and are arranging for rental properties to serve as housing at no cost to families, Green said. More than 1,400 people had been taken in at emergency shelters.Deanne Criswell, the FEMA director, said the agency had 150 people on the ground and that additional search teams and dogs would be arriving within a day or two.RAPID ADVANCEAuthorities began allowing residents back into west Maui on Friday, although the fire zone in Lahaina remained barricaded. Officials warned there could be toxic fumes from smoldering areas and said search operations were continuing.Hundreds of people were still missing, though a precise count was not clear.At a family assistance center in Kahului, June Lacuesta said he was trying to locate nine relatives who had not been heard from since Tuesday."When I see Lahaina town itself, I cannot describe the feelings I get," said Lacuesta, who was headed to a church shelter next to continue his search.The disaster began just after midnight on Tuesday when a brush fire was reported in the town of Kula, roughly 35 miles (55 km) from Lahaina.About five hours later, power was knocked out in Lahaina. In updates posted on Facebook that morning, Maui County said a three-acre (1.2-hectare) brush fire cropped up in Lahaina around 6:30 a.m. but had been contained by 10 a.m.Subsequent updates were focused on the Kula fire, which had burned hundreds of acres and forced some local evacuations. But at around 3:30 p.m., according to the county's updates, the Lahaina fire flared up.Some residents began evacuating while people including hotel guests on the town's west side were instructed to shelter in place. In the ensuing hours, the county posted a series of evacuation orders on Facebook, though it was not clear whether residents were receiving them as people frantically fled the fast-advancing flames.Some witnesses said they had little warning, describing their terror as the blaze destroyed the town around them in what seemed to be a matter of minutes.

Text Content: MOSCOW, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Ukrainian forces are trying to pierce Russian lines in the western parts of Donetsk region where waves of Ukrainian fighters were used to gain a foothold to the east of the town of Staromaiorske, a Russian-installed official said.Vladimir Rogov, a Russian-installed official in parts of Zaporizhzhia controlled by Moscow, said that there had been intense fighting south of Velyka Novosilka - in that area - as Ukrainian troops try to pierce Russian lines to push down to the coast on the Sea of Azov."The enemy managed to enter and gain a foothold in the northern part of Urozhaine after two weeks of the heaviest and bloodiest battles for this settlement," Rogov said, referring to the same part of the frontline.He said Russian soldiers still controlled the southern part of Urozhaine, adding that Ukrainian forces were clearly aiming to take control of a town further south, Staromlynivka.Ukraine launched a counteroffensive in June, attempting to retake swathes of territory captured by Russia in the south and east of the country. It has recaptured several villages in the south and some territory around the ruined city of Bakhmut in the east, but has so far not achieved major gains against well-dug in Russian troops.Moscow says the Ukrainian counteroffensive has failed.

Text Content: MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) — An Alabama boat co-captain was hanging on “for dear life” as men punched and tackled him on the capital city’s riverfront, he told police after video of the brawl circulated widely online.Dameion Pickett, a crew member of the Harriott II in Montgomery, described the brawl in a handwritten statement to authorities included in court documents, saying he was attacked after moving a pontoon boat a few feet so the city-owned riverboat could dock.Four white boaters have been charged with misdemeanor assault in the attack against Pickett, who is Black, as well as a teen deckhand, who was punched and is white. The deckhand's mother heard a racial slur before Pickett was hit, she wrote in a statement.A fifth person, a Black man who appeared to be hitting people with a folding chair during the subsequent fight, has been charged with disorderly conduct, police announced Friday.Video of the melee sparked scores of memes and video reenactments.Pickett told police that the captain had asked a group on a pontoon boat “at least five or six times” to move from the riverboat's designated docking space but they responded by “giving us the finger and packing up to leave.” Pickett and another deckhand eventually took a vessel to shore and moved the pontoon boat “three steps to the right," he wrote.He said two people ran rushing back, including one cursing and threatening to beat him for touching the boat. Pickett wrote that one of the men shouted that it was public dock space, but Pickett told them it was the city's designated space for the riverboat. He said he told them he was "just doing my job." Pickett said he was punched in the face and hit from behind. Pickett said.“I went to the ground. I think I bit one of them. All I can hear Imma kill you” and beat you, he wrote. He couldn’t tell “how long it lasted” and “grabbed one of them and just held on for dear life,” Pickett wrote.After the fight was over Pickett said he apologized to the riverboat customers for the inconvenience as he helped them get off the boat.Story continuesThe deckhand had gone with Pickett to move the pontoon boat. His mother, who was also on the Harriott, said in a statement to police that her son tried to pull the men off Pickett and was punched in the chest.Darron Hendley, an attorney listed in court records for two of the people charged, declined to comment. It was not immediately clear if the others had an attorney to speak on their behalf.Montgomery Mayor Steven Reed said Friday that the investigation is ongoing.Police said they consulted with the FBI and determined what happened on the riverfront did not qualify as a hate crime. Reed, the city's first Black mayor, said he will trust the investigative process, but said his “perspective as a Black man in Montgomery differs from my perspective as mayor.”“From what we’ve seen from the history of our city — a place tied to both the pain and the progress of this nation – it seems to meet the moral definition of a crime fueled by hate, and this kind of violence cannot go unchecked," Reed said. “It is a threat to the durability of our democracy, and we are grateful to our law enforcement professionals, partner organizations and the greater community for helping us ensure justice will prevail.”

Text Content: (Corrects , in second paragraph)By Tom Hals and Jody GodoyWILMINGTON, Delaware (Reuters) - A Delaware judge approved AMC Entertainment's revised stockholder settlement on Friday, three weeks after the judge rejected a related deal by the cinema operator.The ruling sent the shares of the company's preferred stock soaring 27%. The company's common stock fell 27%.AMC has told investors it is burning cash at an unsustainable rate and that the settlement would clear the way for the company to sell more shares and pay down some of its $5.1 billion in debt.Under the approved class action settlement, AMC will provide stock worth an estimated $129 million to holders of its common stock to settle potential legal claims related to a stock conversion plan.The approved class settlement did not allow shareholders to opt out and binds them to the agreement.On July 21, the same judge, Delaware Vice Chancellor Morgan Zurn, rejected a prior version of the settlement because it also settled potential claims by preferred shareholders who were not represented in the lawsuit.That provision was removed from the proposed settlement that Zurn approved on Friday.More than 2,800 objections to the initial settlement were filed by shareholders, a level of interest Zurn called "unprecedented." Many of those objectors sought permission to opt out of the settlement and sue on their own behalf, dismissing AMC's dire financial predictions as "fear tactics."Zurn said an opt-out was not feasible and would be detrimental to the company and its shareholders.The company was sued in February for allegedly rigging a shareholder vote that would allow AMC to convert preferred stock to common stock and issue hundreds of millions of new shares.The investors who sued alleged AMC had come up with the plan to circumvent the will of common stock holders who opposed the company diluting their holdings.Without the proposed settlement, common stockholders and preferred shareholders would end up owning 34.28% and 65.72% of AMC, respectively. Under the proposed settlement, common stockholders and preferred shareholders would own 37.15% and 62.85%, respectively.Story continuesThe case is In re: AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. Stockholder Litigation, No. 2023-0215, in the Delaware Court of Chancery.(This story has been corrected to show the company's common stock fell 27%, not rose 27% in paragraph 2)(Reporting by Tom Hals in Wilmington, Delaware, editing by Deepa Babington)

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- China’s farmers are facing an earlier than expected assault on their crops this year as extreme weather accelerates the spread and growth of destructive diseases and pests such as the dreaded fall armyworm.At risk are key crops including corn and rice, a globally important food staple that’s already seeing threats to supply elsewhere in Asia. China is the world’s biggest producer and importer of the grain that feeds billions.Plant pests that ravage crops are becoming more destructive and posing a bigger threat to the world’s food security due to climate change, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization, a UN agency. China’s government said heavy rains and winds, including those whipped up recently by deadly Typhoon Doksuri, have helped with the migration of insects and spread of disease.Insects that devour rice paddies and corn fields have appeared earlier in major growing regions in China’s north and south this year, according to a unit of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs. Along with the recent rains and flooding, warmer weather has also aided the spread of pests.“More extreme weather events, brought on by climate change, has a significant impact on migration and occurrence of crop diseases and insects,” said Hu Gao, a professor at Nanjing Agricultural University. “It’s getting harder to predict, as the incursion has become a bit irregular.”Hu’s key focus is the planthopper and leaf roller, two common invaders of rice paddies. He says the occurrence of the insects in southern China — where most of the nation’s crop is grown — is more severe than the past few years, although he added that the impact on production is so far limited.Story continuesAny significant damage to rice output would likely place additional strain on the global market should China need to import more. Prices in Asia jumped to the highest level in almost 15 years this week on supply issues.Each year, plant diseases cost the global economy over $220 billion and insects at least $70 billion, according to the FAO. As much as 40% of the world’s crops are lost to plant pests, the UN agency said.Fall armyworm has been detected in 20 provinces in China so far in 2023, and has appeared in the nation’s major growing region in the north earlier than previous years, the government said. However, state-run Beijing News reported that control measures have prevented most of the insects from crossing the Yangtze river, reducing the impact on crops.Corn rust, a fungal pathogen that can kill plants, is also causing headaches.“It just started to emerge,” said Song Quanyong, a farmer in the central province of Henan. “In previous years, it would come much later, near harvest time. All I can do is spray some pesticide and try to control its spread. Fall armyworm is here too, but not much.”The crop in Henan is typically harvested around October, meaning the earlier arrival of corn rust leaves plants more susceptible to damage. The province accounted for almost 8% of the national harvest in 2021.China is bracing for more extreme weather following the heavy rains caused by Typhoon Doksuri, which destroyed some crops in the northeast, known as the nation’s grain basket. Remnants of another storm — Khanun — is set to lash the provinces of Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning, and Inner Mongolia region.--With assistance from Kevin Dharmawan.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: DUBAI, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabian Mining Company , known as Ma'aden, said on Sunday its second-quarter profit tumbled more than 90% on lower sales prices and higher expenses as it flagged a mixed outlook for its products.Ma'aden posted net profit of 350.9 million riyals ($93.53 million) in the second quarter, down 91.3% from just over 4 billion riyals a year prior, the firm said in a stock exchange filing.That missed analysts' average estimate of 577.6 million riyals in net profit for the second quarter, according to Refinitiv data.It was also 16.3% below Ma'aden's first-quarter net profit of 419.4 million riyals.The fall in profit was due to lower average realized sales prices for all products except gold, higher general and administrative costs "including expected credit loss allowance by 40%," exploration and technical services expenses rising 116%, an 86% increase in finance cost due to higher interest rates and profit from a Ma'aden joint venture dropping 59%.Also contributing to the fall was the Islamic tax "zakat, income tax and severance fees expenses (rising) by 2%," Ma'aden said in the filing.The fall in profit was despite higher sales volumes for all products except ammonia, primary aluminium and flat rolled products, a 6% fall in cost of sales due to a decrease in raw material costs - partly offset by higher production costs, 17% lower selling, marketing and logistics expenses, higher income from deposits and a 164% rise in other non-operating income."We are beginning to see an improvement in raw material pricing and, despite the challenging market environment, remain well placed to meet the growing long-term demand for our products," Ma'aden Chief Executive Robert Wilt said in a statement.The realized price of ammonia averaged $253 per metric ton in the second quarter from $643 in the first quarter. Ma'aden expected prices of ammonia to remain stable in the third quarter "as supply tightness continues to provide marginal upside."It sees the phosphate market stabilizing in the third quarter on strong demand in the Americas and a mixed outlook for aluminium due to soft demand in some markets. Ma'aden sees gold trading in its current range for the rest of the year and raw material prices continuing to ease, "supporting profitability."($1 = 3.7518 riyals) (Reporting by Yousef Saba Editing by Bernadette Baum)

Source: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biden-house-democrats-hope-curbing-113910017.html
Text Content: WASHINGTON (AP) — Congressional Democrats are teaming up with the Biden administration and a progressive advocacy group to turn policy efforts to curb “ junk fees ” into a political rallying cry, betting that a small but potentially potent kitchen table issue will resonate with voters.President Joe Biden promised in this year's State of the Union address to target unexpected fees tacked on to things like plane and concert tickets, hotel rooms, hospital and cellphone bills and housing transactions. He's since worked with major businesses to see that pricing is more transparent about all fees.More than a dozen House Democrats around the country plan to hold events organized with help from the Progressive Change Institute to promote the administration's effort to curb junk fees. Events have already happened in suburban Detroit, Philadelphia, central New Jersey and Albuquerque, New Mexico. Similar efforts are planned in coming weeks in Pittsburgh, New York and Las Vegas, as well as in Wisconsin, Ohio and North Carolina. Still others are in the works.“Hidden and deceptive junk fees cost Americans billions of dollars every year," said Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the Democratic House leader. "House Democrats will continue to work with President Biden to fight these excessive fees, hold corporations accountable and lower costs for families across the country.”Rep. Elissa Slotkin a swing-district Michigan Democrat who is now running for the Senate, is planning an event in a few weeks and said “the administration’s initiative to eliminate junk fees will put money back in peoples’ pockets.”Fellow Michigan Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib referred to seat assignment fees in saying she was “taken aback to see airlines charging more for you to sit next to your child" during an event last week at a health center outside Detroit with Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell.The push is part of “ Bidenomics,” the president's effort to stimulate the economy by increasing social spending in ways he says can strengthen the middle class. It could ease the sting of inflation, which has moderated in recent months but remains high. But it may also help Biden bridge the gap between an economy that many metrics show is strong — with low unemployment rates and wages rising — and polling suggesting that many Americans don't view that as a positive for Democrats.Story continues“We’ve got to be in a position to show people what we’ve done," Biden said at a fundraiser last week for his 2024 reelection campaign in New Mexico, referring to public perceptions on the economy. He added: “It doesn’t show. It takes time for people to realize why that’s there."The Biden administration has used executive action to try to limit ticketing and medical fees, and used federal agencies to try to curb unexpected chargers in banking, airlines and other sectors. The president also announced in June that company executives meeting with him at the White House, including from Live Nation Entertainment, the parent company of Ticketmaster, and SeatGeek, had agreed to disclose more ticketing fees up front so consumers have a better idea of final pricing as they comparison shop.House Democrats have introduced legislation to crack down on unexpected fees and, at their events, some are seeking to localize the issue, inviting people to speak about their experiences of being forced to pay them.One such story comes from Joe Pfister, a 36-year-old paralegal. He had been looking to buy a home for a year and a half and went for a tour of the Brooklyn co-op he eventually bought on the day before New York shut in the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. But he wasn't expecting thousands of dollars in additional fees that came later from the mortgage lender, real estate agent and co-op company.“They just kind of sprang up one at a time, and you just had to keep paying to move your application forward,” said Pfister, whose unexpected charges included more than $400 worth of questionnaire fees, $200 in COVID-19 cleaning fees and a $750 move-in deposit. “You were kind of on the ride and you couldn't get off."The Progressive Change Institute's political arm, the Progress Change Campaign Committee, was closely allied with Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s 2020 presidential campaign, which was built around championing consumer protections and promoting progressive causes through economic populism. Combating unexpected fees could be an extension of that theme, with appeals for progressives but also for moderate Democrats and swing voters.“Fighting surprise junk fees is super popular and bipartisan with the public because everyone hates these abusive extra costs," said Adam Green, the Progressive Change Institute co-founder.The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the party's House campaign arm, says its members are spending the August recess trumpeting the economic impact of Biden-championed legislation promoting domestic microchip production and the Inflation Reduction Act, which advanced green energy and drastically increased federal social spending. But some lawmakers, including in competitive districts, are pointing to quelling junk fees as a pocketbook issue that voters will feel more immediately than data points about the larger economy.“Bidenomics is about growing the middle class, which is why President Biden is spearheading the fight against junk fees that are unjustly raising costs," said Kevin Munoz, a spokesperson for Biden's reelection campaign.The White House sees the effort as an example of good governance with bipartisan benefits. Consumer Reports conducted a 2018 survey that found that at least 85% of Americans have experienced a hidden or unexpected fee for a service in the previous two years.Still, some Republicans dismiss the issue as a distraction that won’t have a lasting impact. “Dumpster fires polled better with the American people than Bidenomics, so extreme Democrats threw it in the garbage to talk about ‘junk fees’ because they know Biden’s economy is trash,” quipped Will Reinert, a spokesperson for the National Republican Congressional Committee, the GOP’s House campaign arm.Republican South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, who is now running for president, told Fox News Radio in February: “Having fee control, income control, price control, it sounds more like socialism than free markets and capitalism.”The Biden administration says industry groups have embraced greater transparency on fees, believing they can give consumers comparing prices a more accurate picture of costs — as long as they apply to everyone. But capping such fees is a different matter and could cause some pushback, it acknowledges.“I think most people experience at least one kind of junk fee each month,” said Bharat Ramamurti, deputy director for the White House’s National Economic Council and a former top economic adviser to Warren. “Across party lines, there’s broad support for addressing these fees, either eliminating them or disclosing them up front so that people can shop with full transparency.”Pfister predicted that combating hidden fees would get voters' attention.“I think this is very much a working class issue," he said. “This is, I think, a good tactic for Democrats to take to show that they are on the side of everyday people — that they don't respond to monied interests only and that they're doing something to protect consumers.”

Text Content: *Wall Street dips after inflation data*US PPI increases in July*Oil prices settle higher, dollar index gains(Updates prices throughout at 1457 EDT (1857 GMT), adds comment)By Sinéad CarewNEW YORK, Aug 11 (Reuters) - A global index of stocks fell on Friday while U.S. Treasury yields rose after a July inflation reading showed prices rising slightly faster than expected, fueling expectations the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates higher for longer.The U.S. producer price index (PPI) for final demand rose 0.3% in July, according to the Labor Department. This compared with economist expectations for 0.2%. And in the 12 months through July, the PPI rose 0.8% against estimates for 0.7%.On Thursday, Wall Street's main indexes had finished flat, giving up most early gains on milder-than-feared consumer price inflation data.But also on Friday a survey showed U.S. consumer sentiment climbing to the highest level in nearly two years in July with calming inflation and a strong labor market boosting consumers.While he saw the sentiment survey as good news for investors, John Augustine, chief investment officer at Huntington National Bank, said the bond market's reaction to the inflation data was causing a ripple effect in the stock market."It's bond yields driving the day. Higher bond yields generally take the Nasdaq down," he said, noting that investors were focused on the Fed, earnings estimates and the rising price of oil futures.Friday's data suggested to Paul Christopher, head of global investment strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis, that the Fed will need to keep rates higher for longer and he said "it puts additional rate hikes back on the table for this year.""We think there's some reassessment of inflation going on with investors looking further under the hood. Disinflation has been very rapid in the past months at the top level but that may be leveling out here a little," Christopher said.Story continuesIn stocks, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 105.25 points, or 0.3%, to 35,281.4. The S&P 500 lost 4.78 points, or 0.11%, to end at 4,464.05 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 76.18 points, or 0.56%, to finish at 13,644.85 after both hit their lowest levels in a month earlier in the day.For the week the Dow rose 6.2%. The S&P fell 0.3% and the Nasdaq dropped 1.9%, marking two consecutive weeks of losses for both indexes the first time this year.MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.54%. for the week the global index was down 0.70% marking its first back-to-back weekly loss since May.In currencies, the U.S. dollar touched 145.00 against the yen, which was its highest since June 30. The Japanese yen was last down 0.14% versus the greenback at 144.94 per dollar.The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, rose 0.214%, with the euro down 0.32% to $1.0944.Sterling was last trading at $1.2698, up 0.18% on the day after GDP data showed Britain eked out unexpected growth in the second quarter, helped by a strong June performance.On the U.S. Treasuries side, benchmark 10-year notes were up 8.4 basis points at 4.166%, from 4.082% late on Thursday.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Freezing winter weather seems a remote concern as Europe swelters, but traders and strategists got a reminder last week of the continent’s fragile energy security and bond-market risks.Spot natural gas prices leapt almost 30% in one day after strike threats in Australia jolted investors.ING Groep NV, Rabobank and Saxo Bank A/S recommend positioning for a hawkish pivot from the European Central Bank as energy prices rise again, saying officials will look to stop long-term inflation expectations from drifting ever higher.“Suddenly some inflation alarms are ringing again,” said Benjamin Schroeder, senior rates strategist at ING. “Recent swings in the price for natural gas highlight the lingering risk of supply disruptions to the more benign inflation dynamics of late.”The next big focus for the market is the ECB’s own inflation expectations survey due Monday. But energy prices are ailing a host of markets including the UK, which lacks natural gas storage. The nation reports inflation data on Wednesday.While Europe’s cold-weather supplies are plentiful, the region is still paying four times more than the US and about double what it was before the pandemic. As energy prices jumped, a market gauge of long-term inflation expectations tested the highest level since 2010 last week, which traders say will make it hard for the ECB to justify an end to its tightening cycle.ING’s Schroeder cautioned that ECB hawkishness could escalate to contain the price-growth risks. He warned against jumping into curve-steepening trades — bets that yields on longer-dated bonds will rise faster than shorter notes. Markets should not underestimate the central bank’s “resolve and persistence,” he said.Story continuesRead more: Europe’s Rising Inflation-Risk Gauge Is a Headache for ECBEurope’s reliance on liquefied natural gas imports was turbocharged by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Weaning itself off Russian energy supplies fed the bout of inflation that started last year and risks fanning future price pressure as the region remains highly vulnerable to any disruption to global energy markets.Money-markets currently price a 40% chance of a 25 basis point hike from the ECB in September, with a further 66 basis points of cuts priced for next year. Rabobank echoed the likelihood that the ECB will need to show “more determination” to deal with inflation given the risk of further upward energy shocks.“Energy is a really important crux for the ECB,” said Lyn Graham-Taylor, a senior rates strategist at Rabobank. He prefers European bond-steepening trades focused on the less policy-sensitive five- and 30-year curves — in contrast to the two- and 10-year curves.Winter on the WaySaxo Bank A/S blamed traders building higher energy prices into their positions for the steady rise of market-based inflation measures.“Energy is the component that is going to keep inflation elevated and above the central bank target,” said Althea Spinozzi, senior fixed income strategist at Saxo Bank. “Winter is coming, natural gas is going to be more in demand.”Rather than additional rate hikes, Spinozzi expects the ECB to stay on hold for longer. She favors the policy sensitive short-end of the yield curve, expecting the yield curve to flatten until October.For State Street & Trust Co. the jump in prices is unlikely to result in a dramatic change to the ECB’s policy outlook, as the moves were not as dramatic as the ones seen last year and inflationary pressures continue to cool down elsewhere.“If this is solely an energy price shock, it should not force too broad of a rethink in the market pricing for policy rates,” said Tim Graf head of EMEA macro strategy.But factor in squeezed global food-supply chains, extreme weather events and WTI crude near a nine-month high — and a whole host of factors threatens to fan the pace of inflation.“Parts of the market are saying the ECB needs to hike in September,” said Orla Garvey senior fixed income portfolio manager at Federated Hermes.“A jump in headline inflation is an underpriced risk.”--With assistance from Greg Ritchie and James Hirai.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: LAHAINA, Hawaii (AP) — Richy Palalay so closely identifies with his Maui hometown that he had a tattoo artist permanently ink “Lahaina Grown” on his forearms when he was 16.But a chronic housing shortage and an influx of second-home buyers and wealthy transplants have been displacing residents like Palalay who give Lahaina its spirit and identity.A fast-moving wildfire that incinerated much of the compact coastal settlement last week has multiplied concerns that any homes rebuilt there will be targeted at affluent outsiders seeking a tropical haven. That would turbo-charge what is already one of Hawaii’s gravest and biggest challenges: the exodus and displacement of Native Hawaiian and local-born residents who can no longer afford to live in their homeland.“I’m more concerned of big land developers coming in and seeing this charred land as an opportunity to rebuild,” Palalay said Saturday at a shelter for evacuees.Hotels and condos “that we can’t afford, that we can’t afford to live in — that’s what we’re afraid of,” he said.Palalay, 25, was born and raised in Lahaina. He started working at an oceanfront seafood restaurant in town when he was 16 and worked his way up to be kitchen supervisor. He was training to be a sous chef.Then came Tuesday’s wildfire which lay waste to its wooden homes and historic streets in just a few hours, killing at least 89 people to become the deadliest wildfire in the U.S. in a century.Maui County estimates more than 80% of the more than 2,700 structures in the town were damaged or destroyed and 4,500 residents are newly in need of shelter.The blaze torched Palalay’s restaurant, his neighborhood, his friends’ homes and possibly even the four-bedroom house where he pays $1,000 monthly to rent one room. He and his housemates haven’t had an opportunity to return to examine it themselves, though they’ve seen images showing their neighborhood in ruins.He said the town, which was once the capital of the former Hawaiian kingdom in the 1800s, made him the man he is today.Story continues“Lahaina is my home. Lahaina is my pride. My life. My joy,” he said in a text message, adding that the town has taught him “lessons of love, struggle, discrimination, passion, division and unity you could not fathom.”The median price of a Maui home is $1.2 million, putting a single-family home out of reach for the typical wage earner. It’s not possible for many to even buy a condo, with the median condo price at $850,000.Sterling Higa, the executive director of Housing Hawaii’s Future, a nonprofit organization that advocates for more housing in Hawaii, said the town is host to many houses that have been in the hands of local families for generations. But it’s also been subject to gentrification.“So a lot of more recent arrivals — typically from the American mainland who have more money and can buy homes at a higher price — were to some extent displacing local families in Lahaina,” Higa said. It’s a phenomenon he has seen all along Maui’s west coast where a modest starter home two decades ago now sells for $1 million.Residents with insurance or government aid may get funds to rebuild, but those payouts could take years and recipients may find it won’t be enough to pay rent or buy an alternate property in the interim.Many on Kauai spent years fighting for insurance payments after Hurricane Iniki slammed into the island in 1992 and said the same could happen in Lahaina, Higa said.“As they deal with this — the frustration of fighting insurance companies or fighting (the Federal Emergency Management Agency) — many of them may well leave because there are no other options,” Higa said.Palalay vows to stay.“I don’t have any money to help rebuild. I’ll put on a construction hat and help get this ship going. I’m not going to leave this place,” he said. “Where am I going to go?”Gov. Josh Green, during a visit to Lahaina with FEMA, told journalists that he won’t let Lahaina get too expensive for locals after rebuilding. He said he is thinking about ways for the state to acquire land to use for workforce housing or open space as a memorial for those lost.“We want Lahaina to be a part of Hawaii forever," Green said. "We don’t want it to be another example of people being priced out of paradise.”___McAvoy reported from Wailuku, Hawaii.

Text Content: (Reuters) -Chindata Group said on Friday it would go private in a sweetened $3.16 billion deal with investor Bain Capital, ending months of uncertainty over the future of the Chinese data center operator that also received interest from China Merchants Group.The all-cash offer from Bain Capital, Chindata's largest investor with 87% of voting power and 42% of outstanding shares, values each American depository share of the company at $8.60.That is a 7.5% increase from the private equity firm's proposal in June. It also marks a premium of about 43% to the closing price of Chindata shares before the initial approach was made public.U.S.-listed shares of Chindata, which operates data centers in China, India and Southeast Asia, rose 3% after the bell.Data centers operators have enjoyed a surge in demand in recent years as more businesses take to the web. They also stand to benefit from this year's rise of artificial intelligence services such as ChatGPT, which require massive computing power.Bain Capital, which took Chindata public on the Nasdaq in September 2020, said earlier this year it will not sell any of its shares in the company after it received a bid from China Merchants Capital for $3.4 billion.The go-private deal announced on Friday will be funded through a combination of cash and debt financing provided by Shanghai Pudong Development Bank, Chindata said. It is expected to close during the fourth quarter of 2023 or early next year.(Reporting by Manya Saini in Bengaluru; Editing by Shinjini Ganguli)

Text Content: Aug 12 (Reuters) - The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said Saturday it is investigating a near collision between a Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 and a Cessna Citation business jet in San Diego, the latest in a series of troubling U.S. aviation incidents.The FAA said its preliminary review shows an air traffic controller on Friday had cleared the Citation to land on the same runway at San Diego International Airport that it had instructed Southwest Airlines Flight 2493 to taxi onto. The facility’s automated surface surveillance system alerted the controller about the developing situation and the controller directed the Cessna to discontinue landing.A person briefed on the matter said the initial review shows the Cessna passed over the top of the Southwest airplane by about 100 feet. The FAA is sending a team to the facility to investigate. (Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Andrew Heavens)

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- One of China’s largest developers is wobbling and has less than 30 days to avoid a default on its bonds, the latest signal of the government’s struggle to end the nation’s property slump as the economy slows.Country Garden Holdings Co., which had total liabilities of 1.4 trillion yuan ($194 billion) at the end of last year, said it had underestimated the market downturn and is facing the biggest challenge since it was established in 1992. The property firm expects to post a net loss of up to 55 billion yuan for the first half of 2023 compared with earnings of about 1.91 billion yuan a year earlier.Country Garden Real Estate Group Co Ltd. said it will suspend trading in nearly a dozen onshore bonds starting Monday, two days after the Chinese real estate company’s controlling shareholder said it would report a multi-billion-dollar loss for the first half of this year.The developer’s liquidity crunch is adding to concerns about the potential drag the industry will have on growth in the world’s second-largest economy, sending a Bloomberg index of the country’s junk dollar bonds to the lowest level since last year on Thursday.“What Country Garden messaged in the latest announcement just confirmed investors’ worst fears about the dire state of China’s ailing property market,” said Wee Liam Goh, a portfolio manager at UOB Asset Management.Regulators across China’s government have been seeking since late last year to revive demand in the real estate sector, which makes up about a fifth of China’s gross domestic product. Measures such as easing mortgage rates on first-home purchases have so far failed to stem the crisis, with home sales tumbling the most in a year in July.Story continuesThe downturn has left the property sector caught in a vicious cycle, after an earlier government campaign aimed at getting developers to deleverage caused housing purchases to slump. That crimped the cash flow of builders, leading to a record amount of defaults.Unprecedented protests broke out across cities last year as builders ran out of cash to complete and deliver apartments to buyers, spurring policymakers to intervene. The Communist Party pledged further easing of property measures following its Politburo meeting in late July.“While there have been positive policy signals” since then, “the property sector requires more tangible and timely policy support for stabilization,” said Andy Suen, co-head of Asia ex-Japan fixed income at PineBridge Investments. “Persistent defaults among developers could further dampen homebuyer confidence.”The latest crisis came after bondholders of two dollar notes issued by Country Garden, helmed by one of China’s richest women Yang Huiyan, failed to receive coupon payments due Aug. 7, according to bondholders who requested anonymity.The renewed turmoil comes just as signs emerge that economic demand is weakening as hopes of a rapid recovery following the rollback of pandemic measures fizzle out.Consumer and producer prices fell in July from a year ago, the latest data show. The statistics bureau said the contraction is likely to be temporary and consumer demand is improving.Ultimately, “the economic recovery from the Covid reopening is mainly a consumption recovery, which makes it even more crucial to rescue the real estate sector at the current juncture,” said Tommy Wu, senior China economist at Commerzbank AG. “The failure of another major Chinese developer would pose tremendous pressure on the already-slowing economy.”Week in ReviewOn the Move©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: By Clark MindockAug 11 (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Friday rejected a challenge to federal approvals for the Mountain Valley Pipeline, in a decision that likely ends legal fights over the construction of the $6.6 billion natural gas project led by Equitrans Midstream.A three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, said, “There is no longer a live controversy” to consider after Congress in May passed a law expressly ratifying approvals for the 303-mile (488-km) pipeline running through West Virginia and Virginia.The U.S. Supreme Court in late July lifted orders the 4th Circuit issued earlier in the month temporarily blocking construction on a final 3.5-mile (5.6-km) segment of the pipeline through the Jefferson National Forest.“I think this is the end of the potential legal challenges, really, when it comes down to it,” said attorney Jared Margolis of the Center for Biological Diversity, one of several groups challenging the project in court.A representative for the developer said it is "committed to finalizing" work on the project by the end of 2023.The U.S. Interior Department declined to comment.Mountain Valley is owned by units of Equitrans Midstream, the lead partner building the pipeline, as well as NextEra Energy, Consolidated Edison, AltaGas and RGC Resources among others.The pipeline was initially projected to be finished by late 2018 but was delayed by opposition from groups that claimed it would cause environmental damage and increase the use of climate change-causing natural gas.Proponents of the pipeline claim it is key to unlocking more gas from Appalachia, the biggest shale gas-producing basin in the United States.Approval for the pipeline was included in the debt limit deal struck in May between Democrats and Republicans in Congress.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- One of China’s best-performing bond fund managers boosted holdings of local government financing vehicles after a key economic policy meeting last month fueled optimism in the debt-laden sector.“We took a heavy position in LGFV bonds after the Politburo meeting,” said Zhang Yi, investment director of the asset management department at Guolian Securities Co., referring to the gathering in July of the Communist Party’s 24-member top decision-making body. She said there were positive policy signals from the meeting, with a pro-growth tone regarding support for local government debt and the property sector.Combined two-year performance of the public fixed income funds under her command ranks in the top 7% of their category, according to local fund-data provider Shanghai Tiantian Fund Distribution Co.Zhang’s investment call comes at a time when there have been growing concerns about the $9 trillion debt market for LGFVs, which were created to finance projects like roads, airports and power infrastructure. Investors across Asia earmarked China’s ballooning levels of municipal borrowing as the region’s number one financial risk in a recent survey. The entities rarely generate enough returns to cover their obligations, and many local authorities are facing cash-flow problems due to the country’s years-long real estate crisis.Bloomberg News reported Friday that China will allow provincial-level governments to raise about 1 trillion yuan ($139 billion) via bond sales to repay debt of LGFVs and other off-balance sheet issuers, a step toward addressing one of the biggest threats to the nation’s economy and financial stability.Story continuesZhang has specialized in Chinese bond investments for nearly two decades, including three years as a manager for the nation’s Social Security Fund.Each fixed-income fund at Guolian Securities’ asset management arm recently increased their LGFV positions by 20% to 40%, she said. The division had more than 100 billion yuan of entrusted funds at the end of 2022.“Until there is a default on LGFV’s public debt, we will maintain a high-position portfolio in LGFV bonds,” according to Zhang. It’s difficult to imagine that LGFVs are in trouble on a large scale, she said, adding that sector bonds are currently cost-effective because of their yield and most being safe from default.The LGFV market has posted gains this year despite the pockets of worries. Spreads have narrowed for medium-term yuan bonds versus government bond yields, Bloomberg-compiled data show. LGFV dollar notes have returned 4.66% for 2023, according to an iBoxx gauge.For selecting LGFV bonds, Zhang’s strategy entails conducting in-depth research on a provincial basis and then choosing a few locales to prioritize investments. She focuses on whether a provincial government can clearly know the debt situation of its governing counties — including maturity size, fundraising methods and the effectiveness and execution of provincial debt-resolution plans.“Most of the ones we bought have AA+ ratings, which have already avoided most of the tail risks,” Zhang said.While no LGFV has missed payment on a public bond, repayment risks recently came under renewed scrutiny after China’s state pension fund advised asset managers handling its money to sell notes including those issued by riskier LGFVs. There have been cases of last-minute bond repayments while LGFV commercial-paper delinquencies have been on the rise as China’s economy slows.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

The company raised $424 million alongside founder and backer L Catterton. Oddity also counts money managers Baillie Gifford and Franklin Templeton as cornerstone investors.A favorable review from analysts could drive another leg higher for the company which was underwritten by banks including Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley, Allen & Company, BofA Securities, Barclays Capital, Truist Securities, JMP Securities and KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.The so-called quiet period for ratings from analysts at firms that participated in Oddity’s IPO ends Aug. 14.“The valuation is a little bit disconnected from fundamentals,” said David Trainer, chief executive officer of New Constructs, adding that the stock’s price signals expectations for the company are extremely high.Oddity has a market value approaching $3 billion, while Sally Beauty Holdings is valued at about $1.2 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The stock’s debut followed a string of consumer companies going public, including Cava Group Inc., Savers Value Village Inc. and Johnson & Johnson spinoff Kenvue Inc. The listings signal momentum is back in the IPO market amid an equities rebound after a lull at the start of the year.Read ECM Watch: Oddity’s Debut Surge Is an Encouraging Sign for IPOsStory continuesAnalysts at underwriting banks often start their coverage on favorable terms. Savers Value Village was no exception, the company now boasts eight buy ratings and no holds or sells, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Meanwhile Cava — which has surged 120% since going public — has accrued six buy ratings, three holds and no sells from analysts covering the restaurant chain. The fast-casual restaurant chain notched an 11% bump when its quiet period expired in July.Of course, not all of this year’s IPOs have been able to hold onto early gains after a wave of analyst initiations.

Text Content: By Mike Blake and Marco GarciaKAHULUI, Hawaii, Aug 12 (Reuters) - The scale of the Maui wildfires' destruction came into sharper focus on Saturday, as officials warned the death toll of 80 would likely rise and search teams with cadaver dogs sifted through the charred ruins of Lahaina looking for more victims.The cost to rebuild the historic resort town was estimated at $5.5 billion, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), after the fast-moving flames consumed more than 1,000 buildings and leveled almost the entire town.Officials vowed to examine the state's emergency notification systems after some residents questioned whether more could have been done to warn people before the fire overtook their homes. Some were forced to wade into the Pacific Ocean to escape.Sirens stationed around the island - intended to warn of impending natural disasters - never sounded, and widespread power and cellular outages hampered other forms of alerts.The state's attorney general, Anne Lopez, said she was launching a review of the decision-making both before and during the fire, while Governor Josh Green told CNN he had authorized a review of the emergency response.Local officials have described a nightmarish confluence of factors, including communications network failures, powerful wind gusts from an offshore hurricane and a separate wildfire dozens of miles away, that made it nearly impossible to coordinate in real time with the emergency management agencies that would typically issue warnings and evacuation orders.The death toll made the inferno, which erupted on Tuesday, Hawaii's worst natural disaster in history, surpassing a 1961 tsunami that killed 61 people a year after Hawaii became a U.S. state.RAPID ADVANCEAuthorities began allowing residents back into west Maui on Friday, though the fire zone in Lahaina remained barricaded. Officials warned there could be toxic fumes from smoldering areas and said search operations were continuing.Story continues"It's going to be sad to get down there," said Za Dacruz, 33, as he waited on Friday in a traffic jam to try to return to Lahaina. "We're just looking for everyone to be alive, to be safe - that's all we're trying to do. And the rest? We'll go from there."Hundreds of people were still missing, though a precise count was not clear.At a family assistance center in Kahului, June Lacuesta said he was trying to locate nine relatives who had not been heard from since Tuesday."When I see Lahaina town itself, I cannot describe the feelings I get," said Lacuesta, who was headed to a church shelter next to continue his search.The disaster began just after midnight on Tuesday when a brush fire was reported in the town of Kula, roughly 35 miles (56 km) from Lahaina.About five hours later, power was knocked out in Lahaina. In updates posted on Facebook that morning, Maui County said a three-acre (1.2-hectare) brush fire cropped up in Lahaina around 6:30 a.m. but had been contained by 10 a.m.Subsequent updates were focused on the Kula fire, which had burned hundreds of acres and forced some local evacuations. But at around 3:30 p.m., according to the county's updates, the Lahaina fire flared up.Some residents began evacuating while people, including hotel guests, on the town's west side were instructed to shelter in place. In the ensuing hours, the county posted a series of evacuation orders on Facebook, though it was not clear whether residents were receiving them as people frantically fled the fast-advancing flames.Some witnesses said they had little warning, describing their terror as the blaze destroyed the town around them in what seemed to be a matter of minutes.

Text Content: WASHINGTON (AP) — Even President Joe Biden has some regrets about the name of the Inflation Reduction Act: As the giant law turns 1 on Wednesday, it's increasingly clear that immediately curbing prices wasn't the point.While price increases have cooled over the past year — the inflation rate has dropped from 9% to 3.2% — most economists say little to none of the drop came from the law.“I can’t think of any mechanism by which it would have brought down inflation to date," said Harvard University economist Jason Furman, who added that the law could eventually help to lower electricity bills.Alex Arnon, an economic and budget analyst for the University of Pennsylvania’s Penn Wharton Budget Model, offers a similar assessment.“We can say with pretty strong confidence that it was mostly other factors that have brought inflation down,’’ he said. "The IRA has just not been a significant factor.’’That shouldn't come as a surprise.When the Inflation Reduction Act was proposed, the Congressional Budget Office said its impact on inflation would be “negligible."So why the name? It may ultimately help to hold down prices in the future — and it fit the politics of the moment..The law was proposed shortly after the American public learned that consumer prices were climbing upward at the fastest pace in four decades. Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York had been holding private talks about Biden's agenda and put forth the name Inflation Reduction Act once they had a deal. Biden pledged at the time that it would “reduce inflationary pressures.”The law is now at the core of Biden's pitch to voters going into the 2024 presidential campaign. But with inflation less of a pressing concern, the president is putting more emphasis on its provisions aimed at combating climate change, creating jobs and lowering people’s health care bills.“I wish I hadn’t called it that because it has less to do with reducing inflation than it has to do with providing alternatives that generate economic growth,” Biden said Thursday at a fundraiser in Utah, adding that he still believes that with the law "we’re literally reducing the cost of people being able to meet their basic needs.”Story continuesWhile the law may not have crimped inflation over the past year, it could well do more in that regard going forward, since it just now is starting to be implemented. Along with the CHIPS Act, there are also signs that the Inflation Reduction Act helped to stimulate roughly $500 billion in corporate announcements to invest in new factories. This has potentially helped to strengthen the job market despite efforts to bring down the inflation that many economists believed would pull the United States into a recession. That recession — as Biden predicted — has not materialized.Even though the law did not immediately reduce inflation, it appears to have done little to cause prices to explode upward as Republicans had claimed it would. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said last August that Biden's agenda would push inflation upward, only to have the rate fall over the past year.“They’ll raise inflation higher,” McCarthy told Fox News in an interview. “They'll spend more money, which brought us into this problem. "Biden, on his three-state western swing this past week, emphasized to donors and voters how the law addresses climate change and promotes the creation of jobs as the economy moves toward renewable energy.“It has nothing to do with inflation,” Biden said at a New Mexico fundraiser. “It has to do with the $368 billion, the single-largest investment in climate change anywhere in the world, anywhere. No one has ever, ever spent that. And it’s beginning to take hold.”If it wasn't the IRA that deserves the credit, what did cause inflation to tumble?Economists are listing three big reasons:—Oil and gasoline prices fell from last year's peak. Gas prices had spiked 60% in June 2022 from a year earlier, caused in large part by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But gas prices steadily fell until this January, when they began to climb without having returned to their earlier peak.—The Fed aggressively raised its benchmark interest rate, which made it more expensive to borrow and slowed demand that had been pushing up prices. The Fed's rapid hikes have nearly doubled average mortgage rates, pushing down existing home sales. Home prices have also declined slightly in the past year, which can put downward pressure on rental costs. Other interest-rate sensitive industries, particularly autos, have also seen prices fall after sharp increases during the pandemic.—The supply chain kinks that caused shortages coming out of the pandemic got unsnarled. A measure of supply chain difficulties constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has fallen below even pre-pandemic levels as shipping costs have declined.Republican lawmakers and some economists blamed last year's high inflation on the administration's $1.9 trillion pandemic relief as being excessive, yet any impact of that on inflation also appears to have now waned.“The big moves in inflation are primarily global shocks,” said Kristin Forbes, an economist at MIT and a former member of the Bank of England’s interest-rate setting committee. “Those are the primary drivers, but not the only ones. What the Fed has done has also contributed, without a doubt.”Biden administration officials have said that their actions contributed to lower inflation. By releasing oil from the U.S. strategic reserve, they say, they reduced the financial pain at the gas pump. The administration also created a task force to improve U.S. port activity and supply chains. The White House also stayed quiet on Fed rate hikes, giving the central bank the independence to work without political pressure.Biden has been careful not to declare an outright victory against inflation, as it's still higher than the Fed's 2% target. But the White House says the cost savings from the Inflation Reduction Act are coming as the law is getting enacted.Tax credits will reduce the cost of installing rooftop solar panels by 30%, which will in turn lower monthly electricity bills. Tax credits also make it more affordable to install a heat pump to control a home's central air, possibly trimming energy bills by $1,000 annually. There are other tax credits for energy efficient doors and windows as well as new insulation.Electric utilities using the tax credits for renewable energy will pass roughly $8.2 billion in savings to their customers. People can defray the costs of buying a new electric vehicle with a $7,500 tax credit.The law also has measures related to health care. Biden has often said in speeches that Medicare recipients will have the monthly cost of their insulin capped at $35. Starting in 2025, there will be a $2,000 limit on out-of-pocket prescription drugs that will save 19 million people on Medicare an average of $400 annually. The CBO estimated that people enrolled in Medicare Part D, which involves prescription drugs, will have their personal costs lowered by $25 billion in 2031.Taken together, the law could help protect the U.S. economy against the rising oil costs and broken supply chains that triggered the most recent bout of high inflation.“The IRA will be a big plus for the economy in the long-run as it reduces the economy’s reliance on fossil fuels," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. "It will make the economy less vulnerable to spiking oil prices, which have contributed to nearly every recession since World War II.’’___Associated Press writers Christopher Rugaber and Fatima Hussein contributed to this report.

Text Content: (Updates first paragraph, settlement price in graph 2, and Baker Hughes weekly report in paragraph 10) Aug 11 (Reuters) - U.S. natural gas futures were little changed on Friday, as rising inventory offset support from forecasts for hot weather and higher cooling demand. Front-month gas futures for September delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange settled 0.7 cent, or 0.3%, higher at $2.77 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) after dropping 6.6% on Thursday. However, the contract was up 7.5% for the week. "The biggest factor is that our production is still going strong. The EIA storage report certainly has shown that the production is strong enough to meet the domestic demand despite the abnormally high temperatures for the last week," said Zhen​ Zhu, managing consultant at C.H. Guernsey and Co in Oklahoma City. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported on Thursday that utilities added 29 billion cubic feet (bcf) of gas into storage during the week ended Aug 4. That was slightly bigger than the 25-bcf build analysts forecast in a Reuters poll, and lifted stockpiles to 3.030 trillion cubic feet (tcf), 11% above the five-year average. Power demand in Texas hit an all-time high on Thursday for the third time this week and will likely break that record again as homes and businesses keep their air conditioners cranked up during the lingering heat wave, according to forecasts by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the state's power grid operator. Extreme heat boosts the amount of gas burned to produce power for cooling, especially in Texas, which gets most of its electricity from gas-fired plants. In 2022, about 49% of the state's power came from gas-fired plants, with most of the rest from wind (22%), coal (16%), nuclear (8%) and solar (4%), federal energy data showed. Meteorologists forecast the weather in the lower 48 states will remain hotter than normal through at least Aug. 26. Data provider Refinitiv forecast U.S. gas demand, including exports, would rise from 103.0 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) this week to 104.5 bcfd next week as power generators burn more of the fuel and exports rise. The forecast for next week was lower than Refinitiv's outlook on Thursday. U.S. energy firms this week cut the number of oil and natural gas rigs operating, which is an early indicator of future output, for a fifth week in a row, energy services firm Baker Hughes said in its weekly report. Refinitiv said average gas output in the U.S. lower 48 states was 101.9 bcfd so far in August, nearly the same as the 101.8 bcfd in July. That compares with a monthly record of 102.2 bcfd in May. Gas flows to the seven big U.S. LNG export plants have fallen from an average of 12.7 bcfd in July to 12.3 bcfd so far in August, mainly due to reductions at Venture Global LNG's Calcasieu facility in Louisiana. That compares with a monthly record of 14.0 bcfd in April. The U.S. is on track to become the world's biggest LNG supplier in 2023 - ahead of recent leaders Australia and Qatar - as higher global prices feed demand for U.S. exports due to supply disruptions and sanctions linked to the war in Ukraine. Dutch and British wholesale gas prices mostly fell as the prospect of strikes at Australian LNG facilities appeared to ease after companies involved began talks to avert industrial action. "The prospect of US LNG cancellations seems more remote, especially if risks of strikes in Australian LNG facilities materialize," Goldman Sachs said in a note. In 2022, roughly 69%, or 7.2 bcfd, of U.S. LNG exports went to Europe as shippers diverted cargoes from Asia to get higher prices. In 2021, when prices in Asia were higher, just 35%, or about 3.3 bcfd, of U.S. LNG exports went to Europe. With the return of higher gas prices in Asia this year, analysts said they expect U.S. LNG exports to Asia will increase. Just 19%, or 2.1 bcfd, of U.S. LNG exports went to Asia during the first half of 2023, while 70%, or 8.0 bcfd, went to Europe.

Text Content: By Lisa Baertlein(Reuters) - Former customers of bankrupt trucking firm Yellow can expect to see rates rise at least 10%-20% from the rock-bottom levels that helped usher in the demise of that nearly 100-year-old firm, industry analysts and executives said on Friday.Yellow, formerly known as YRC, was one of the largest U.S. trucking firms and a leader in the "less-than-truckload" (LTL) market that combines shipments from multiple customers on a single truck. Rivals who are picking up Yellow's business say they are not dropping their own prices do so.Two long-time industry executives told Reuters that Yellow's rates were roughly 10% to 20% below those of rivals. Loads in the so-called LTL market do not trade on the spot market and they vary based on the type and size of shipments, they said."Yellow was way below" market rates, said Ken Adamo, chief of analytics at DAT Freight and Analytics, which operates one of North America's largest truck freight marketplaces.Former Yellow customers should expect to see rates rise at least that much to reach market parity, said Chris Pickett, an analyst and chief operating officer at Flock Freight, which matches shippers to fill up individual trucks.That, however, may not be the end of the increases, Pickett said. Unlike the highly fragmented trucking market, LTL is dominated by about a dozen players. Those companies have more pricing power, and with Yellow gone there is less competition for the freight they handle.Some providers are already raising rates, which could send LTL rates up 10% to 15% from current levels, Pickett said. "That's going to create some sticker shock."Large companies like Walmart, Amazon.com and Home Depot will likely see the smallest rate increases as they shift cargo from Yellow.Savvy customers like those likely locked up new carriers prior to Yellow's bankruptcy on Aug. 7, Adamo said.Yellow has blamed the International Brotherhood of Teamsters union for its failure. But the union and analysts blamed mismanagement, saying the debt-laden company's sub-market rates made it difficult to offset the high cost of running the companies it bought as separate entities.Story continuesNow rival trucking firms like Forward Air are benefiting from Yellow's failure.Forward Air picked up some of Yellow's business, CEO Thomas Schmitt said on the company's Aug. 3 earnings call."Yellow leaving the market will further accentuate pricing discipline ... I do believe the bottom is behind us," Schmitt said of the sector's current "freight recession."(Reporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles; Editing by Marguerita Choy)

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Officials raised the death toll from devastating wildfires on the Hawaii island of Maui to 80 as rescue and clean-up crews continued to dig through the rubble of the historic town of Lahaina.Authorities said firefighters are still working to contain flare-ups in Lahaina, Pulehu/Kihei and Upcountry Maui, according to a statement from Maui County. Around 1,000 people remained unaccounted for, police said earlier. County water officials told residents not to drink tap water because of concerns it was contaminated from the fires.“We have suffered a tragedy here in Hawaii,” Governor Josh Green said Friday in a video posted on Facebook. “The fires on Maui have been devastating. But we have hope.”Green said Thursday that the death count would probably rise as search crews work through the damage that he characterized as looking like a bomb scene. The blazes destroyed 1,000 or more structures, Green said. Accuweather Inc. put the preliminary estimate of damage from the fires at $8 billion to $10 billion.Aerial surveys found more than 270 buildings burned in the seaside resort of Lahaina, once the capital of the Hawaiian Kingdom. Thousands of residents and tourists had fled an area left without electricity, phone service or the internet. After witnessing the damage first hand, the governor said it was likely the largest natural disaster in Hawaii’s history.Photos and videos posted to social media this week depicted apocalyptic scenes. The flames — fanned by strong winds from a hurricane far off the coast — barreled through the town so quickly that residents had little time to flee, and some even jumped into the ocean to escape. The Coast Guard said it rescued more than a dozen people from the waters off Lahaina on the West Maui coast.Story continuesHawaii’s Attorney General’s office will conduct a “comprehensive review of critical decision-making and standing policies leading up to, during and after the wildfires,” the department said in a statement Friday.Read more: 13 Photos Show the Destructive Force of Wildfires in MauiThe old Lahaina, including its Front Street tourist destination once packed with waterfront restaurants and shops, has been destroyed, Green said. Almost every building in Lahaina, he said, would need to be replaced, taking many years and billions of dollars. Initial damage estimates in all likelihood will climb as the fullest extent of the wreckage becomes known.President Joe Biden on Thursday declared a major disaster in Hawaii, freeing up federal funds to aid recovery. More than 1,400 people were at emergency evacuation shelters in six locations on Friday, authorities said.The Federal Emergency Management Agency is assisting with search and rescue efforts in Lahaina, Anne Bink, associate administrator of response and recovery, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television.The agency has a stockpile of water and ready-to-eat meals on hand, and will arrange short-term shelter for people whose homes have been lost or damaged, in addition to assisting with the eventual rebuilding process, Bink said.Read More: Hawaii Wildfires Become More Frequent as Drought Withers GrassGreen’s administration was reaching out to nearby hotels emptied of vacationers to secure 2,000 rooms for the displaced. But he also asked island residents whose homes remained intact to take in people needing shelter.“All of us have a loved one here on Maui that lost a home, that lost a friend,” Green said.The type of grass fire that hit Lahaina spreads extremely quickly, according to climate and wildfire expert Mojtaba Sadegh, an associate professor of civil engineering at Boise State University. The blaze was spread by winds from a high-pressure zone to the north that swept downwards toward Hurricane Dora, a low-pressure zone off to the south.While such complexities make it harder for scientists to define the role global warming may have had in exacerbating the disaster, climate change is extending the length of fire season and increasing areas burned in many parts of the world. A recent study Sadegh co-authored found that between 2000 and 2019, the number of people in the US exposed to wildfire risk doubled.The fire was one of several that erupted this week on Maui, the second-largest of the Hawaiian islands.While it is unknown what sparked the flames, they drew their destructive power from some of the same conditions that have fueled devastating blazes this year from Canada to Greece: vegetation sucked dry by drought and strong winds. Some 36% of Maui County is in moderate to severe drought, according to the US Drought Monitor.Read More: Wildfire Expert on What Fed Deadly Flames in Hawaii: Q&AWildfires used to be rare in Hawaii, but they started becoming more frequent in the 1990s as many of the old agricultural plantations and ranches closed, said Clay Trauernicht, a wildfire management specialist at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. Invasive, non-native grasses took over fallow land and have provided new fuel for blazes.Some communities are trying to reforest these grass lands, using tree shade to control the grasses, or return them to agriculture, but not at the scale needed, he said.“We’ve just primed ourselves for a disaster like this,” Trauernicht said.(Updates with death toll, fire-fighting efforts from first paragraph)©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

It was the first time in 2023 that the Nasdaq fell for two straight weeks. The S&P 500 ended the week down 0.3%, with the Nasdaq 1.9% lower.The U.S. government reported that the producer price index (PPI) climbed 0.8% in the 12 months leading to July, up from a 0.2% rise in the previous month, as costs of services increased. Economists polled by Refinitiv had expected a 0.7% gain.Though traders broadly expect the Federal Reserve to refrain from tightening credit conditions for the rest of the year, bets for no rate hike in September slipped to 88.5% from 90% before the data landed."We've seen some material news and data in recent days but the market has chosen to trade sideways, which tells us that the market had priced in everything and has not been pleasantly or unpleasantly surprised," said Jason Betz, private wealth advisor at Ameriprise Financial.Yield on the two-year U.S. Treasury note, that moves in line with near-term interest rate expectations, climbed to 4.88%.This move weighed on big tech names, as high interest rates could slow the economy and dent the ability of these firms to achieve the growth projections which have pushed them to premium valuations. Higher rates can also make interest-bearing bonds an attractive alternative to stocks for some risk-averse investors.Story continuesTesla, Meta Platforms Inc and Microsoft closed down between 0.6% and 1.3%.A 3.6% fall in Nvidia weighed on the semiconductor index, which was 2.3% lower. It was the fourth straight decline and its eighth loss in nine sessions for the semis index, and its 5% weekly decline was its worst performance since early April.Megacap growth and technology stocks have led outsized gains this year in the tech-heavy Nasdaq and the S&P 500 . But after a five-month stretch of advances, August has so far been marked by a more cautious approach from investors."Time will tell if we are correct on this, but with the run that tech has had, it's hard not to want to do a bit of profit-taking," said Ameriprise's Betz.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 105.25 points, or 0.3%, to 35,281.4, the S&P 500 lost 4.78 points, or 0.11%, to 4,464.05 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 76.18 points, or 0.56%, to 13,644.85.Amid the major S&P sectors, healthcare and energy sectors advanced. Both have been among the worst performing industries this year, although energy matched its strongest run this year by closing higher for the seventh straight session.The energy sector's 1.6% increase was aided by crude prices rising on forecasts for tightening supplies from the International Energy Agency. Occidental Petroleum Corp was among the biggest gainers, up 3.3%, after one of its units secured a grant from the U.S. government to support its carbon capture ambitions.Among other movers, News Corp rose 4.6% after the Rupert Murdoch-owned media conglomerate beat quarterly profit estimates, thanks to its cost-cutting efforts.U.S.-listed shares of Chinese companies Alibaba and JD.com fell 3.5% and 5.3%, respectively, as Beijing's latest stimulus measures disappointed investors, while fresh data showed that the country's post-pandemic recovery was losing steam.Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.19 billion shares, compared with the 10.93 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.The S&P 500 posted 4 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 52 new highs and 169 new lows.(Reporting by Bansari Mayur Kamdar and Johann M Cherian in Bengaluru and David French in New York; Additional reporting by Shashwat Chauhan; Editing by Vinay Dwivedi and David Gregorio)

The speed of the Lahaina fire, which appears to have started on the eastern edge of town and was rapidly blown westward to the sea, likely led to the high death toll, he said.Buses scooped up tourists Thursday from the resorts that line the shore north of Lahaina and ferried them directly to the island’s Kahului Airport, where more than 1,400 people spent the night awaiting morning flights. Another 1,300 people slept in shelters, according to the county.President Joe Biden on Thursday declared a major disaster in Hawaii, freeing up federal funds to aid recovery. “Anyone who has lost a loved one or whose home has been damaged or destroyed is going to get help immediately,” he said at an event in Salt Lake City.Read More: Biden Vows to Rush Federal Support to Wildfire-Ravaged HawaiiCrews are working to clear roads and other areas of trees and debris. Emergency responders continued combing the wreckage for survivors or the deceased.Wildfires used to be rare in Hawaii, but they started becoming more frequent in the 1990s as many of the old agricultural plantations and ranches closed, said Clay Trauernicht, a wildfire management specialist at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. Invasive, non-native grasses took over fallow land and have provided new fuel for blazes.Some communities are trying to reforest these grass lands, using tree shade to control the grasses, or return them to agriculture, but not at the scale needed, he said.“We’ve just primed ourselves for a disaster like this,” Trauernicht said.--With assistance from Christine Buurma.(Adds details on access to Lahaina resuming in sixth paragraph)©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Source: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-revised-stock-conversion-plan-203715470.html
Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. won court approval of a stock conversion plan that had spurred a shareholder lawsuit and cast a cloud over the movie theater chain’s efforts to secure new financing.The settlement, approved on Friday, includes extra shares for individual investors, thousands of whom had opposed it, citing the dilution of their shares among other concerns. Many of them fueled the pandemic-era “meme stock” rally that saved AMC from a bankruptcy filing.The ruling by Delaware Chancery Court Judge Morgan Zurn caps a protracted and bitter legal fight over AMC’s preferred equity units, or APEs, which pitted the company’s top executives against part of that retail investor base. Last month Zurn surprised the market by rejecting an earlier version of the settlement, sending the value of AMC’s regular shares soaring and the APEs plunging. She found that the original deal waived too many potential claims against the company.Read the judge’s opinion hereAMC shares sank as much as 34% in postmarket trading, while the preferred shares spiked more than 29%, narrowing the spread between the two to around $1.50.Offsetting the DilutionIn a 110-page opinion, Zurn concluded that the settlement was reasonable, finding that while the plaintiffs’ claim of breach of fiduciary duty had merit, a remedy for that claim was “challenging to identify.” She noted that the revised pact included “additional shares of common stock awarded to current common stockholders to offset the dilutive effects.”Zurn’s basic job was to decide whether the settlement was fair given the strength, or weakness, of the shareholders’ claims. She concluded that their main legal theory was relatively strong but not a sure thing, and that their risk of losing made the settlement a fair deal.Story continues“Where a plaintiff establishes directors acted with the primary purpose of impeding the exercise of stockholder voting power,” the company’s board members “must demonstrate their actions were reasonable,” the judge wrote. She said AMC actually didn’t convince her of that, but that it “may have been able to prevail” if it had gone to trial.The settlement has been valued at as much as $120 million, depending on AMC’s volatile stock price. It wasn’t immediately clear when the APE conversion would take place, but AMC officials have said they hope to raise new financing by the middle of this month. Zurn said approval of the deal clears the way for the company to act and that it has indicated it intends to do so “as quickly as possible.”The case began when a pension fund and other shareholders challenged the plan to let APE holders — many of them arbitragers betting on the stock conversion — vote on AMC’s recapitalization proposals. Hedge fund Antara Capital LP holds roughly 30% of the APEs. More than 2,800 shareholders opposed giving the APE investors a vote.In rejecting the earlier version of the settlement, Zurn cited sections that would have waived any claims by holders of the common stock, including those also holding APEs. The resubmitted settlement included a narrower release, waiving only claims “that relate to the ownership of common stock.”Meme PlayersThe meme stock investors’ role has made the case unusual, especially as the focus of the legal proceedings has turned to the accord. In writing to the court to oppose the stock conversion plan, some expressed the dilution concerns, while others cited market manipulation theories that have spread online.AMC created the APEs last year to get around a share limit it couldn’t lift without the support of retail investors. With the settlement it aimed to address their objections by handing out one extra class A share for every 7.5 held, a ratio that has put the pact’s value at around $110 million to $120 million.In announcing the revised accord last month, AMC Chief Executive Officer Adam Aron stressed the “critical” importance of getting the deal approved and the APEs converted so the company can raise new equity capital.The lead objector to the accord, a retail trader named Rose Izzo, has sought to derail it, take over the case and resume the court fight on behalf of others in her camp who feel “stabbed in the back” by AMC and its leaders, her lawyer has said.Chancery and BarbieIzzo had asked Zurn to put any stock conversion on hold to leave time for an appeal if the judge approved the settlement. Given the success of the blockbusters Barbie and Oppenheimer and AMC’s strong second-quarter financial results, the company’s “overhyped concerns and unreasonable demands ring hollow,” she said in a court filing.AMC’s shares have been on a wild ride because some traders and hedge funds, as part of their arbitrage bets, have been adding to their APE positions and going short AMC shares. They’ve been betting they will be able to pocket the spread once the conversion goes through and narrows the price gap between the two. Zurn’s earlier ruling against the conversion proposal forced them to start unwinding that bet to limit their risk, boosting the shares.Litigation continues on other fronts. AMC has sued its insurers for refusing to fund the settlement, and another holder of the common stock is seeking a court order requiring the company to hold its first annual meeting and board election in more than 13 months. Antara is facing a securities lawsuit in federal court seeking the return of its alleged short swing profits.The case is AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. Shareholder Litigation, 2023-2015, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).--With assistance from Jennifer Kay and Yiqin Shen.(Adds context to stock reaction in first section and more of judge’s reasoning in second.)©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Source: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biden-regional-carbon-cleanup-hubs-110008947.html
Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- The Biden administration awarded $1.2 billion in support of companies looking to pull carbon from the ambient air on Friday. It did so endorsing a specific strategy: that grouping like-minded companies and researchers in hubs is the most effective way to scale the nascent technology.Projects proposed by a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Corp. for Kleberg County, Texas, and by Climeworks AG, Battelle Memorial Institute and Heirloom Carbon Technologies Inc. for Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana, were selected for the first handout of funding. The federal government has said a total of $3.5 billion will go toward direct air capture (DAC) hubs, with the Department of Energy (DOE) saying it plans to issue funding for future awards “in the coming years.”The DAC hubs are a bet that bringing companies together in central locations can supercharge innovation, both in terms of improving the machines that capture carbon from thin air and how the industry engages with a public that will come face to face with the emerging technology for the first time.Startups currently have the capability of grabbing a few thousand tons of carbon pollution from the atmosphere each year using machines. That’s exceedingly small, owing in part to high energy needs and the capital costs to build the machines themselves. Cheap storage also remains a challenge. But nearly all scenarios where the world limits warming to 1.5C will require removing billions of tons of CO2 from the air annually by mid-century, whether by mechanical or natural processes.Improving efficiency will be absolutely crucial to getting the machines to live up to their promise. So, too, will verifying they’re actually delivering on the Biden administration’s goal of removing 1 million tons of CO2 at each hub annually by 2030. (Industry experts also view that as a critical milestone to gauging if DAC can reach the billion-ton scale by mid-century.)Story continuesThe group overseeing the Louisiana hub has contracted with Gulf Coast Sequestration Inc., a local company that will stash the CO2 captured by Climeworks and Heirloom’s technology. Doing so will pair up a novel constellation of companies and researchers to test new ways of capturing and storing carbon that may otherwise have not worked together. That could help the industry as a whole mature.“It creates this opportunity not just to have a major facility but also to create a testbed where the second generation of technologies can validate their tech in the real world.” said Giana Amador, the executive director of the Carbon Removal Alliance, whose members include Climeworks and Heirloom.The DOE, which is overseeing the hubs, has seen some high-profile struggles funding arrays of individual projects. A 2021 Government Accountability Office report found, for example, that the Department of Energy invested $1.1 billion in carbon capture projects — that is, technology to grab CO2 at the smokestack — with what it called “varying levels of success.” That includes $300 million in funding for projects that were never built.Technological success is only part of the equation for the hubs, though. The Biden administration also said the hubs will have to align with its Justice40 initiative, which is focused on ensuring at least 40% of any federal investment accrues in disadvantaged communities. The Texas and Louisiana hubs have promised to create 2,500 and 2,300 jobs respectively, which would certainly be one way of benefiting locals.Both will also be situated in areas that have been overburdened with fossil fuel infrastructure, with the Texas hub being led by 1PointFive, a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum. Scientists view carbon removal’s main role once scaled up as twofold: remediating historic emissions and also tackling problems that can't be addressed through other means such as electrifying cars or installing renewable energy.But siting hubs in fossil fuel strongholds and funding one run by an oil company could end up perpetuating the industry, said Sara Nawaz, the director of research at American University's Institute for Carbon Removal Law and Policy. She added it could be perceived as greenwashing, which could also color the public’s perception.“This will be really the public's first physical interaction with a direct air capture facility, which gives us a lot of good information about how we do community engagement and environmental justice engagement on these projects,” Amador said.A misstep — whether a failure to deliver promised jobs or promised carbon removal — would make the pathway to scaling DAC rapidly much harder. If the large hubs don’t find innovative ways to engage with the public or otherwise stumble, the results could hurt the industry’s long-term prospects.“It’s really key to do engagement well because if you don’t, then you risk the whole technology being discarded or taken off the table,” Nawaz said.The stakes are very high. In a report earlier this year, carbon removal policy nonprofit Carbon180 noted there’s a “small margin for error for scaling DAC.”There’s also a lot of money on the line. Beyond the DOE’s investment $3.5 billion program to fund a total of four hubs, there are also tax credits built into the Inflation Reduction Act that companies working on DAC could cash in on. All told, the market for carbon removal including DAC and other techniques could reach $1 trillion by 2037, according to BloombergNEF estimates. That will hinge on a lot of things lining up, from policies to community support. And the hubs could well be the starting point for that line to form.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: A federal judge has set off a debate among legal scholars by ordering lawyers for Southwest Airlines to undergo “religious-liberty training” by a conservative Christian legal group.Critics say that if the judge believes such training is necessary, he should have found a less polarizing group to conduct it.U.S. District Judge Brantley Starr made the decision after ruling that Southwest was in contempt of court for defying a previous order he issued in a case involving a flight attendant who said she was fired for expressing her opposition to abortion. She sued Southwest and won.Starr, nominated to the bench by former President Donald Trump, said Southwest didn't understand federal protections for religious freedom. So this week, he ordered three of the airline's lawyers to undergo religious-liberty training. And he said that the Alliance Defending Freedom, or ADF, “is particularly well-suited" to do the training.The group has gained attention — and high-profile court victories — opposing abortion, defending a baker and a website designer who didn't want to work on same-sex marriages, and seeking to limit transgender rights. It frequently cites First Amendment rights in its litigation.ADF declined to describe its training or to make a representative available for an interview. In an emailed statement, its chief legal counsel, Jim Campbell, said, “The judge’s order calls for ADF to provide training in religious liberty law — not religious doctrine. It is baseless to suggest that people of faith cannot provide legal instruction if their beliefs differ from their audience’s.”Southwest has appealed Starr's sanctions, which also include emailing a statement that the judge wrote to its flight attendants to say that airline is not permitted to discriminate based on employee's religious beliefs. The airline, which is based in Dallas, is already appealing the jury verdict in the flight attendant's favor.Story continuesDavid Lopez, who was general counsel of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission during the Obama administration, said Southwest could argue that training by a conservative Christian group violates the religious rights of its lawyers, especially if any follow other faiths or none at all.Lopez said the EEOC often insisted on training for employers found to have discriminated, but that the agency and the company would agree on who would conduct that training.“What happened here, I've never seen that,” said Lopez, who is now a law professor at Rutgers University.ADF is “just one voice” on the subject of religious freedom, Lopez said, “and they are a voice that many people view as being very controversial and very narrow.”Douglas Laycock, an authority on religious-liberty law who recently retired as a law professor at the University of Virginia, said judges can order extra measures such as training to make sure defendants comply with the rest of an order, but Southwest still has avenues to appeal.Southwest could argue “that ADF has extreme views on these issues and will give distorted training, and there is something to that,” Laycock said. Or, he said, the airline could argue that ADF is essentially a religious organization, and that requiring Southwest lawyers to take training from the group would violate their rights.“ADF presents itself as a religious-liberty organization, but it is really a Christian organization," Laycock said. "It isn’t much interested in anyone else’s religious liberty.”Steven Collis, director of a law and religion clinic at the University of Texas at Austin, said it is within a judge's authority to order this kind of training.“I do think it's questionable ordering that training to be done by a group that is clearly partisan on issues related to religious freedom,” Collis added. “He could have avoided criticism by ordering this from someone who is a little more neutral ... use an academic instead.”Judge Starr was nominated by Trump in 2019 and confirmed by the Senate, then under Republican control, in a party-line, 51-39 vote.The nephew of Kenneth Starr, a former federal judge who led the investigations into former President Bill Clinton that led to Clinton's impeachment in a sex scandal, Starr graduated from Abilene Christian University and earned a law degree from the University of Texas at Austin, where he was editor of a conservative law journal.Starr held senior jobs in the Texas Attorney General’s office. According to a questionnaire he filled out for the Senate Judiciary Committee, he worked on a lawsuit against the Obama administration for telling public schools to let transgender students decide which restrooms to use, defended a state law that banned sanctuary cities for immigrants, and sued to block a plan to defer deportation of some undocumented immigrants.Starr, who had not previously served as a judge at any level, is a member of the Federalist Society, a conservative legal group.The Southwest case stems from the airline's decision to fire Charlene Carter, a flight attendant for more than 20 years, after a series of social media posts and private messages aimed at the president of the flight attendant's union for attending an anti-Trump, pro-abortion-rights march in Washington in January 2017.In one message Carter told the union president, “You truly are Despicable in so many ways," and attached video that purported to show an aborted fetus. An hour later, she sent another video of an aborted fetus.Carter took the case to arbitration but lost. She then sued, and last year a jury in Dallas awarded her $5.1 million from Southwest and the union. Starr later reduced the judgment to about $800,000 to, he said, comply with federal limits on punitive damages.Both the airline and the union are challenging the decision before the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which has not decided whether to hear the case.Carter is represented by lawyers from the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation, which argues that union-represented workers should not be required to pay dues.After Starr's ruling this week, foundation President Mark Mix said, "Hopefully this order provides hope to other independent minded workers that their right to express their religious dissent against union and company political agendas cannot so easily be waved away.”

Text Content: Manhattan federal district court Judge Lewis Kaplan revoked the bail of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried just months before his scheduled trial, a decision that placed the former crypto exchange executive in handcuffs on Friday.Federal prosecutors had alleged Bankman-Fried, 31, violated his bail agreement by communicating with a New York Times reporter about his former girlfriend and primary witness for the prosecution, Caroline Ellison.A gag order is not “a workable solution longer term particularly with someone who has shown a willingness and a desire to risk crossing the line in an effort to get right up to it no matter where the line is,” Kaplan said.Ellison previously served as CEO of Alameda Research, an FTX-affiliated hedge fund, which prosecutors claim Bankman-Fried used to misappropriate FTX customer funds. Ellison has plead guilty to multiple fraud charges and entered a plea deal to testify against Bankman-Fried."Mr. Bankman-Fried’s contact with the New York Times reporter was not an attempt to intimidate Ms. Ellison or taint the jury pool," the fallen crypto executive's lawyers wrote in a letter to Judge Kaplan. "It was a proper exercise of his rights to make fair comment on an article already in progress, for which the reporter already had alternate sources."According to prosecutors, Bankman-Fried shared with the Times reporter Ellison's personal diary-like writings explaining her frustrations with her position leading Alameda.A grand jury in December handed down an indictment charging Bankman-Fried with misusing customer deposits to fuel Alameda. His trial is scheduled to begin October 2.Bankman-Fried as been out of custody since late December following his indictment and extradition from the Bahamas, where FTX was headquartered, to the US.Bankman-Fried’s prior bail conditions, which have been tightened multiple times since they were originally set by US Magistrate Judge Gabriel Gorenstein, require the defendant to reside at his parents’ Palo Alto, California home, along with a $250 million recognisance bond.Story continuesKaplan had previously warned Bankman-Fried that his bail could be revoked.Alexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Text Content: (Updates to show that voting has now started)By Nicolás MisculinBUENOS AIRES, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Argentines headed to the polls on Sunday morning in primary elections, with voters likely to punish the ruling center-left Peronist coalition, angry at inflation scraping 116% and a cost-of-living crisis that has left four in 10 people in poverty.The primary is obligatory for most adults and each person gets one vote, making it in effect a giant dress rehearsal of the general election in October and giving a clear indication of who is the favorite to take the presidency.That will be key for policy affecting Argentina's huge farm sector, one of the world's top exporters of soy, corn and beef, the peso currency and bonds, and ongoing talks over a wobbling $44 billion debt deal with the International Monetary Fund.Polls opened at 8 a.m. (1100 GMT) and voting centers will close at around 6 p.m. (2100 GMT), with the first results expected around 9 p.m. (0000 GMT).The economic crisis has left many disillusioned with the main political parties, the ruling Peronist coalition and the conservative opposition Together for Change, and opened the door for a potential surprise win by a far-right libertarian candidate.Others are planning a protest vote for fringe parties or none at all, a trend which could play against the more moderate candidates in the race, including conservative Buenos Aires Mayor Horacio Larreta or Economy Minister Sergio Massa."I am thinking of leaving my vote blank," said Micaela Panzera, a 22-year-old employee of a food company in Buenos Aires. "No candidate really convinces me."The most important leadership race is in the conservative Together for Change coalition, between centrist Larreta and more hard-line rival, ex-security minister Patricia Bullrich. Both are pledging more austerity and freer markets.A major X factor is libertarian economist Javier Milei, who has been getting nearly one-fifth of the likely vote in opinion polls and winning over voters with a brash, unapologetic style. He wants to dollarize the economy and shut the central bank.Story continues"A strong performance by the libertarian candidate would also constitute a surprise and could point to a contested three-candidate race in October," bank Goldman Sachs said in a note.Pollsters expect low turnout, despite a fine for not voting."Higher abstention should be expected, perhaps also more blank votes. We have seen warning signs of this in the provincial elections held up to now," said political analyst Carlos Fara."The hardest element to predict is Milei's performance, because he's a phenomenon outside the political norm."Pollsters see the combined Together for Change opposition candidates just ahead of the ruling Peronist bloc, with Milei pulling close to 20%. Many, however, admit it's a hard race to predict. In the 2019 primary the polls were proved badly wrong.Whoever wins in October - or more likely in a November runoff - will have major decisions to make on rebuilding depleted foreign reserves, boosting grains exports, reining in inflation and on how to unwind a thicket of currency controls.(Reporting by Nicolás Misculin; Additional reporting by Candelaria Grimberg; Editing by Adam Jourdan and Jonathan Oatis)

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Across Wall Street, there’s growing relief that the Federal Reserve — at long last — may be done raising interest rates. But that doesn’t mean turbulence in the bond market will soon become a thing of the past.Investors anticipate that US Treasuries will continue to be whipsawed by heightened volatility as economic uncertainty threatens to alter the central bank’s path or keep rates pinned higher for far longer than traders currently expect.Already, some Fed officials are underscoring that there may still be more work to do as inflation continues to hold above their 2% target despite the most aggressive monetary policy tightening in four decades. At Barclays, strategists have advised clients to sell two-year Treasuries on anticipation that rates will remain elevated next year, bucking broader speculation that the Fed will initiate a series of rate cuts as soon as March. And benchmark 10-year yields — a baseline for the broader financial system — are pushing back toward last year’s highs.“The rise in long-dated yields has been driven by the hawkish message from the Fed,” said Rob Waldner, chief strategist fixed income at Invesco. “The central bank is staying hawkish and that’s keeping uncertainty high.”That uncertainty, along with an increase in new debt sales as the federal government contends with mounting deficits, has weighed on the bond market. Even with the sharp jump in interest rates, the overall Treasury market returned just 0.1% this year, according to Bloomberg’s index, far short of the big gains once expected to emerge when the end of the Fed’s hiking appeared in sight.After the central bank’s policy meeting in July, when it raised its overnight rate by a quarter percentage point, Chair Jerome Powell emphasized that its decision at the next meeting in September would hinge on the data released over the next two months.Story continuesSo far, the major reports have generally supported speculation that it will hold steady in September, with job growth cooling and signs of easing inflation. But the core consumer price index — which strips out volatile food and energy prices and is seen as a better measure of underlying inflation pressures — still rose at a 4.7% annual pace in July. On Friday, an index of producer prices also rose at a faster-than-expected pace, driving up Treasury yields across maturities.In the coming week, traders will scour the release of the minutes from the July 25-26 FOMC meeting for clues on where policymakers see rates heading and any diverging views between them.The annual gathering of global central bankers in later this month in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, will also be closely watched. It could give Powell a venue to push back on markets pricing in that the Fed will cut its key rate to around 4% by January 2025. It’s in a range 5.25-5.5% now.“The committee is divided,” said Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy for Societe Generale. “The market pricing is showing a lack of conviction. Six cuts are priced in. These are not deep cuts. That’s a high-for-longer story. I cannot see a strong trade here.”What Bloomberg Economics says...“Minutes of the July 25-26 FOMC meeting, to be released Aug. 16, will show that a majority of Fed officials were encouraged by progress on disinflation, but not yet convinced the rate-hike cycle is over.”— Anna Wong, chief US economist— Read her full report, hereEven so, some investors have been pouring into the Treasury market, drawn by the higher interest rates and concern that this year’s stock market rally is unsustainable. That’s put US Treasuries on course for a record year of inflows, according to Bank of America Corp. strategists.US Treasuries on Track for Record Year of Inflows, BofA SaysKerrie Debbs, a certified financial planner at Main Street Financial Solutions, however, has been warning clients that bonds aren’t a sure-fire haven from risk and that the stock market’s push higher may not persist.“There are still a whole host of events that could stall these positive market returns, including continuing inflation, perception of credit quality of US government debt, skyrocketing US budget deficits, political instability in the world and more,” said Debbs, who has around 50 clients and manages about $70 million in total assets.What to Watch--With assistance from Edward Bolingbroke and Farah Elbahrawy.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- The old playbook of selling emerging-market bonds when Treasury yields spike is being upended by the positive dynamics favoring developing-nation debt.Emerging bonds have extended this year’s rally — even as Treasuries slide — on growing expectations for interest-rate cuts and optimism over a global soft landing. The correlation between emerging and US yields has dropped to almost zero, a Bloomberg study shows.“The disinflation process in emerging markets is proceeding faster than we had previously expected — this should allow EM central banks to cut rates sooner and faster than developed-market ones,” said Arun Sai, senior multi-asset strategist at Pictet Asset Management in London. “We remain overweight EM local-currency bonds.”While the Federal Reserve and many of its developed-nation peers have left the door open for further rate hikes, some of their emerging-market counterparts have already started to cut borrowing costs.Chile’s central bank lowered its key rate by a greater-than-expected 100 basis points last month, a decision that sent two-year bond yields plunging on the next trading day. Brazil’s policy makers trimmed their benchmark by a larger-than-forecast 50 basis points on Aug. 2.The consensus for rate cuts in Latin America suggest markets are not yet pricing in the full extent of likely easing.Elsewhere, Hungary’s central bank trimmed its key rate in a third-straight time last month, while policy easing is also being debated in Poland and the Czech Republic.Soft LandingGrowing optimism the Fed will be able to counter inflation without bringing about a recession is also favoring emerging-market bonds more than their developed peers.Story continues“Higher bond yields in developed markets signal a lower probability of a global recession,” said Rajeev De Mello, global macro portfolio manager at Gama Asset Management SA in Geneva. “I expect more resilient global growth to be the dominant force for emerging-market assets.”The above factors help explain why the link between emerging-market bonds and Treasuries is breaking down. The 30-day correlation between US 10-year yields and a Bloomberg index of EM local-currency bonds has fallen to around 0.1, according to analysis by Bloomberg, where zero would indicate no correlation. When US yields surged in February, the correlation rose as high as 0.57, while in March to June 2022, it topped out at 0.61.China ExportsThe slowdown in China is also a positive for broader emerging-market bonds.Recent data from the world’s second-largest economy has added to signs its recovery from the pandemic is faltering. Exports slid in July by the most in more than three years, while consumer and producer prices both dropped last month, the first time that’s happened since 2020.The collapse in China’s export prices and the weak yuan mean the country is essentially “exporting disinflation” to its trading partners in Asia, especially in Southeast Asia, and that is “on the margin, a positive for both bonds and equities” in the region, Pictet’s Sai said.Dollar StrengthAmong the biggest negatives facing emerging-market bonds is a resurgent dollar, which will reduce returns from local-currency assets.Dollar strength driven by the hawkish Fed has pushed down the MSCI emerging-market currency index by 1.5% in August, on track for the biggest monthly loss since February.Still, “the dollar looks overvalued across a suite of valuation metrics, and is less of a headwind to EM local-currency bonds, making it likely that compelling carry can resume its role as key driver of returns,” Grant Webster, a fund manager at Ninety One UK Ltd. in London, wrote in a client note published Tuesday.Dip BuyersEven if emerging-market bonds do decline, any losses may be seen as a buying opportunity given the many positives.A better time to be buying EM debt is during generalized selloffs due to risk aversion related to something else, such as in March with the US regional banks, Samy Muaddi, head of emerging markets fixed income at T. Rowe Price, said in an interview in Melbourne.Correlation Between EM and US Bonds Has FallenWhat to Watch©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: (Recasts, adds Taiwan government response, paragraphs 8-9)By Ryan Woo and Ben BlanchardBEIJING/TAIPEI, Aug 13 (Reuters) - China on Sunday condemned a brief U.S. visit by Taiwan Vice President William Lai, saying he was a separatist and "troublemaker through and through" and Beijing would take strong steps to protect its sovereignty, drawing a rebuke from Taipei.Lai, front-runner to be Taiwan's next president at elections in January, arrived in New York late on Saturday for what is officially a transit on his way to Paraguay for the inauguration of its president.China, which claims democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory, has repeatedly denounced Lai's trip, which includes another stopover in San Francisco on Wednesday on his way back to Taipei.In a statement issued shortly after Lai landed in New York on a scheduled flight from Taipei, China's foreign ministry said it opposed any form of visit by "Taiwan independence separatists" to the United States."Lai stubbornly adheres to the separatist position of Taiwan independence and is a troublemaker through and through," the ministry said.Taiwan is the "core of China's core interests" and facts have shown again and again that the reason for the rise in tensions in the Taiwan Strait is Taiwan trying to "rely on the United States to seek independence", it said."China is closely following developments and will take resolute and vigorous measures to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity."Taiwan's China-policymaking Mainland Affairs Council said China was the real troublemaker, pointing to its standoff this month with the Philippines in the South China Sea and continued military harassment of Taiwan, among other actions."Our government firmly defends national sovereignty and security, guards the lines of defence of democracy and freedom, and will never back down, let alone capitulate," the council said in a statement.Story continuesChina has an especial dislike of Lai, who has previously described himself as a "practical worker for Taiwan independence", though he has repeatedly said on the campaign trail he is not seeking to change the status quo, but that only Taiwan's people can decide their future.'LOW KEY' VISITA person familiar with the trip's planning said Lai will join receptions with overseas Taiwanese during the stopover in New York, during which he will make a speech.He will not meet U.S. lawmakers, the person said, adding Lai will keep the visit "low key", in line with Taipei and Washington's shared position to "jointly manage risks when facing an authoritarian region at this sensitive time".Lai, greeted by supporters waving flags as he arrived at his New York hotel, wrote on social media platform X he was "looking forward to seeing friends and attending transit programs in New York".Laura Rosenberger, chair of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), a U.S. government-run non-profit that carries out unofficial relations with Taiwan, said on X that she would meet Lai in San Francisco, where he is due on Wednesday on his way home.China is likely to launch military drills this week near Taiwan, using Lai's U.S. stopovers as a pretext to intimidate voters ahead of a next year's election and make them "fear war," Taiwanese officials say.On Sunday, the Eastern Theatre Command of China's People's Liberation Army, which is responsible for the area around Taiwan, posted on its WeChat account a short video of fighter jets practicing dog fights at an undisclosed location.It said its forces had recently been engaged in "high-intensity flight training".Lai's transits come as Beijing and Washington are trying to improve relations.That includes the prospect of a visit to the U.S. by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, which could pave the way for a meeting between U.S. President Joe Biden and China's leader Xi Jinping this year.China has stepped up its military activities around Taiwan over the past three years, seeking to force the island into accepting Beijing's sovereignty.In April, China staged war games around Taiwan in an angry response to Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen meeting U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in California on a stopover on the way back to Taipei following her visit to Central America.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- China’s lapse into deflation is emerging as the latest risk for its struggling stock market, denting investor optimism over a much-anticipated earnings rebound.The CSI 300 Index just capped its worst week since March after a drop in consumer and producer prices added to signs of deterioration in the economy. The benchmark of onshore Chinese shares has now erased more than half of the gains spurred by the Politburo’s policy vows in late July. Hopes that earnings will offer fresh catalysts are giving way to fears that companies may lose pricing power.While few expect China to experience the decades-long deflationary spell that has haunted Japan, Beijing’s reluctance to deploy forceful stimulus in the face of weak consumption and a property market slump can keep prices muted for longer. Without a healthy dose of inflation, which generally helps buoy corporate revenue and profits, the stock market risks being stuck in the doldrums.“Lack of inflation means lack of pricing power,” said Mohammed Zaidi, investment director at Nikko Asset Management. “Investors should re-calibrate their earnings expectations for slower growth.”China’s economy has shown increasing strains in recent weeks, with a sharp deterioration in July imports underscoring how domestic demand remains sluggish despite Beijing’s efforts to restore confidence. The nation’s banks extended the smallest amount of monthly loans since 2009, data showed on Friday, adding to signs that recovery in the world’s second-largest economy is faltering.That suggests a turnaround in earnings may take longer than thought, with early readings of the second-quarter results already having painted a bleak picture.Story continuesSome companies have already been forced to reduce prices to survive against the weak macro backdrop. Analysts warn that businesses may fall into a vicious cycle should consumers choose to defer purchases on expectations of more price cuts, prompting companies to sacrifice profits to woo buyers.Forward earnings estimates for firms on the MSCI China Index are edging lower again in August after rising for the first month this year in July, data compiled by Bloomberg show.“There is a risk of corporate earnings being revised downward,” said Wilfred Sit, chief investment officer at Hang Seng Investment Management. “What we need to see now is whether the government is able to come up with some kind of effective policies to boost the economy.”The CSI 300 Index fell more than 3% this week, while a gauge of Chinese shares listed in Hong Kong posted a second week of losses. Both underperformed the broader MSCI Asia Pacific Index.Foreign investors, who snapped up onshore Chinese stocks for two weeks amid the optimism spurred by the Politburo meeting, sold each day this week, withdrawing a net 25.5 billion yuan ($3.5 billion) in all. That was the most for any week since October.For some investors like William Fong, though, the deflationary threat is less of a concern.“Some people may feel a bit worried, but for us, we actually think it will give policymakers more room to boost the economy,” said Fong, head of Hong Kong China equities at Baring Asset Management Asia Ltd. “If they want to cut the interest rates, if they want to cut reserve requirement ratio, they can do it.”It’s also not the first time that China has experienced deflation. Consumer and producer prices fell in tandem in 2009 and 2020. Stock performances back then have been mixed — the MSCI China Index rebounded during the earlier bout of deflation, but entered a downward spiral shortly after the latter period.But there are reasons to be more worried now. Incremental incentives to boost spending have so far been insufficient to excite consumers and businesses scarred by years of Covid restrictions.Authorities also don’t have the fiscal firepower to stimulate the economy. Nor are they willing to aggressively cut interest rates lest it will further increase leverage or add pressure on the already-weak yuan.READ: China’s Reluctance on Stimulus Will Cap 2023 GrowthAnother complication is that China is grappling with deflation at a time when most parts of the world are still tackling stubbornly high inflation. The divergence in monetary policy, which is weighing on the yuan, is a problem for many MSCI China Index members, which do business in the Chinese currency but have shares trading in US dollars.“The deflation phenomenon needs a more concerted approach” but policymakers are preoccupied with managing the property market crisis and worried about further divergence with US rates, said Aninda Mitra, head of Asia macro and investment strategy at BNY Mellon Investment Management. “But doing nothing is steadily unwinding what little sentiment boost they managed to perk up in late July.”--With assistance from Ishika Mookerjee.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Source: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/brazil-rolls-350-billion-investment-122756985.html
Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on Friday rolled out a $350 billion infrastructure investment plan designed to boost Brazil’s economy and kickstart a green transition.The leftist leader, who returned to Brazil’s top office in January promising to restore economic prosperity and prioritize sustainable development, touted the plan as a centerpiece of his presidency.“My third term as president starts today,” Lula, who previously led Brazil from 2003 to 2010, said during an event to launch the program in Rio de Janeiro. “Growth will be correct, fast and sustainable.”The government estimates the plan will create 4 million jobs, and aims to make most of its investments — $264 billion — by the end of his term in 2026, although it did not say how much of that total would come from public funds. Lula’s allies have painted the initiative as a Brazilian version of President Joe Biden’s efforts to stimulate the US economy with roughly $1 trillion in new infrastructure projects and clean energy initiatives.The proposal carries the same name of a plan Lula created in 2007 — Growth Acceleration Plan, or PAC. This time, however, the government says it will place more focus on greener development alongside traditional infrastructure investments.It will rely on a mix of federal funds, concessions and public-private partnerships to help finance a combination of transportation, sanitation and ecological transition projects. About $220 billion will come from public funds, with the private sector kicking in an additional $125 billion, according to an official statement.Energy transition projects will receive a total of $110 billion.Story continuesDespite its scope, the PAC will not prevent the government from zeroing Brazil’s budget deficit in 2024 as it has promised, Finance Minister Fernando Haddad said. All of the plan’s public investments will fit within spending limits set by a new fiscal framework that Brazil’s congress is currently finalizing.Read More: Brazil Readies ESG Bond Debut in Next Overseas Sale This YearElements of the plan, Haddad said in Rio, are part of a larger effort to begin an “ecological transformation” of Brazil’s economy that will also include new regulations for carbon markets and the issuance of green bonds. The government is preparing to hold the country’s first-ever sustainable bond sale later this year.The suite of proposals will make Brazil more attractive to investors while also helping Lula deliver on pledges to combat poverty, Haddad said.“Our plan cannot and will not be the same as those of developed countries,” he said. “The profile of emissions is different, which justifies a different strategy. And the challenge of overcoming poverty in a country still marked by profound social inequality is just as important as the environmental challenge.”Lula has sought to strike a balance between economic development and his green agenda early in his presidency, especially amid a standoff between his top environmental agency and Brazil’s state-controlled oil company, Petroleo Brasileiro SA, over its exploration plans in an ecologically sensitive offshore region.The PAC proposal also includes financing for the Ferrograo railway, a project that would transport grain through part of the Amazon rainforest region and was suspended over environmental concerns. Brazil’s Supreme Court earlier this year allowed technical studies of the project to resume.Read More: Brazil Moves to Allow Amazon Oil Drilling, Marring Lula’s SummitBut Environment Minister Marina Silva, who criticized the previous PAC program over its lack of concern for the environment, praised the design of the new version.“Being able to see development and sustainability within the same plan is an unimaginable gain,” she said during the launch event.Petrobras, as the state-run oil giant is known, will contribute $66 billion to the program, chief executive officer Jean Paul Prates said. The company, which played a prominent role in the original PAC, has a $78-billion, five-year strategic plan and is mulling an increase for the period between 2024 and 2028. It plans to earmark as much as 15% of its total investments for low-carbon projects.The New Development Bank — an institution created by the BRICS bloc of emerging market nations that includes Brazil — will contribute $2.7 billion in financing for sustainable projects, said Aloizio Mercadante, the head of Brazil’s national development bank.The previous Growth Acceleration Plan helped increase public investment and led to the construction of hundreds of highways, bridges, hydroelectric dams and other projects under Lula and his successor, former President Dilma Rousseff.But many of those projects, which were handled by large local infrastructure companies, later faced investigations over corruption allegations. The program helped lead to the rise of Operation Car Wash, the years-long corruption probe that put hundreds of business and political leaders — including Lula, temporarily — behind bars.The PAC program also financed the construction of oil refineries, like a major petrochemical complex in Rio de Janeiro, and the Belo Monte dam, a hydroelectric project in the Amazon region that drew fierce opposition from Indigenous tribes and environmentalists.Its legacy may create challenges for the current plan. The corruption investigations drove many of the involved companies into bankruptcy, while the ensuing end of an era of massive public investments hit firms that hadn’t been implicated, resulting in heavy debts, layoffs and legal disputes.As a result, the government will have to carry out large projects without many of the major contractors that delivered them in the past.At first, local companies are likely to form consortia with foreign partners in order to participate in investment projects, Chief of Staff Rui Costa told reporters at the event. After they get stronger and are able to obtain financing, they will be able to handle projects by themselves, he said.(Recasts lead, adds Lula comments from second paragraph and additional details throughout.)©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

The index was set to snap two consecutive weekly declines.Data showed U.S. PPI increased 0.2% in June. On an annual basis, PPI increased 0.8% through June, while economists polled by Reuters had forecast a 0.7% rise."It would confirm that inflation is back to reasonable levels," said Philip Petursson, chief investment strategist at IG Wealth Management."The real question is will the U.S. Federal Reserve be satisfied. From here, will it be a much slower grind or are they going to say we got to get there faster and raise rates further and that's what the market is trying to assess today."U.S. consumer prices increased moderately in July at 3.2%, up from 3.0% in June, data showed on Wednesday, but core inflation continued to remain sticky, which worried investors on the Fed's rate hike plans for the rest of 2023.The energy sector rose 0.9% as oil prices firmed, while materials gained 1%, tracking higher gold prices.Rate-sensitive technology stocks lost 0.3% after the data.Utilities shed over 0.6% as shares of Northland Power fell over 6%, after the power producer reported a drop in quarterly net income. The stock was the worst performer on the benchmark index.Air Canada rose over 3%, after the Canada's largest airline reported a better than expected quarterly profit on Friday compared with a year-ago loss.(Reporting by Siddarth S in Bengaluru and Nivedita Balu in Toronto; Editing by Shweta Agarwal, Krishna Chandra Eluri and Deepa Babington)

Text Content: By Edward McAllisterDAKAR, Aug 12 (Reuters) - West Africa's regional bloc kept up its search on Sunday for diplomatic ways to overturn last month's coup in Niger, while retaining the threat of military intervention amid a crisis that has sucked in global superpowers.The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) said on Saturday that it aimed to send a parliamentary committee to meet the coup leaders, who have imprisoned Niger's President Mohamed Bazoum and dissolved the elected government, in the seventh coup in West and Central Africa in three years.While the ECOWAS parliament made no firm decisions on Saturday, it set up a committee that plans to meet Nigerian President Bola Tinubu, who holds the bloc's revolving chairmanship, to get his permission to go to Niger, its spokesperson said.The coup leaders, headed by General Abdourahamane Tiani, have rebuffed prior diplomatic efforts by ECOWAS, the United States and others, raising the spectre of further conflict in the impoverished Sahel region of West Africa, which is already dealing with a deadly Islamist insurgency.With diplomacy faltering, ECOWAS has activated a standby military force they say will be deployed as a last resort if talks fail.At stake is not just the fate of Niger - a major uranium producer and Western ally in the fight against the Islamists - but also the influence of rival global powers with strategic interests in the region.U.S., French, German and Italian troops are stationed in Niger, in a region where local affiliates of al Qaeda and Islamic State have killed thousands and displaced millions.Meanwhile, Russian influence has grown as insecurity increases, democracy erodes, and leaders seek new partners to restore order.Western powers fear Russia's clout could increase if the junta in Niger follows neighbouring Mali and Burkina Faso, which ejected the troops of former colonial power France after coups in those countries.

Text Content: (Adds NTSB also investigating, background on FAA actions)By David ShepardsonAug 12 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and National Transportation Safety Board said on Saturday they were investigating a near collision between a Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 and a Cessna Citation 560X business jet in San Diego, the latest in a series of troubling U.S. aviation incidents.The FAA said its preliminary review shows that just before 12 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time (1900 GMT) on Friday, an air traffic controller at San Diego International Airport cleared the Cessna to land on a certain runway even though Southwest Airlines Flight 2493 had already been told to taxi onto the same runway and await instructions to depart.The facility’s automated surface surveillance system alerted the controller about the developing situation and the controller directed the Cessna to discontinue landing.A person briefed on the matter said the initial review shows the Cessna passed over the top of the Southwest airplane by about 100 feet. The FAA is sending a team to the facility to investigate.Southwest said on Saturday it is participating in the FAA’s review of the incident. "Our aircraft departed without event and the flight operated normally, with a safe landing in San Jose as scheduled," the airline said.The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating seven runway incursion events since January, including Friday's San Diego incident.A similar near-collision incident occurred in February in Austin, Texas, when a FedEx cargo plane and a Southwest Boeing 737 came within about 115 feet (35 meters) in poor visibility conditions. The controller had cleared the FedEx plane to land and the Southwest plane to depart.On Thursday, the NTSB cited the failure of a Lear 60 charter pilot to get a takeoff clearance in a February incident in Boston that resulted in a near-collision with a JetBlue flight.The NTSB said the airport surface detection equipment issued an alert, and the air traffic controller gave go-around instructions to the JetBlue flight.Story continuesThe JetBlue Embraer 190 was just 30 feet (9.1 m) above ground when it broke off the landing "close to the point where both runways intersected," the NTSB said, adding the Boston tower told the charter pilot the JetBlue flight passed about 400 feet above them.In March, the FAA said it was taking steps to improve its air traffic control operations after near-miss incidents telling employees: "There is no question that we are seeing too many close calls."The FAA held a safety summit and issued a separate safety alert in March to airlines, pilots and others citing the "need for continued vigilance and attention to mitigation of safety risks."

Economists polled by Refinitiv had expected a 0.7% gain.Though traders broadly expect the Federal Reserve to refrain from tightening credit conditions for the rest of the year, bets for no rate hike in September slipped to 88.5% from 90% before the data landed."We've seen some material news and data in recent days but the market has chosen to trade sideways, which tells us that the market had priced in everything and has not been pleasantly or unpleasantly surprised," said Jason Betz, private wealth advisor at Ameriprise Financial.Yield on the two-year U.S. Treasury note, that moves in line with near-term interest rate expectations, climbed to 4.88%.This move weighed on big tech names, as high interest rates could slow the economy and dent the ability of these firms to achieve the growth projections which have pushed them to premium valuations. Higher rates can also make interest-bearing bonds an attractive alternative to stocks for some risk-averse investors.Tesla and Microsoft both closed down.A fall in Nvidia weighed on the semiconductor index , which posted its fourth straight decline and its eighth loss in nine sessions.Story continuesMegacap growth and technology stocks have led outsized gains this year in the tech-heavy Nasdaq and the S&P 500 . But after a five-month stretch of advances, August has so far been marked by a more cautious approach from investors."Time will tell if we are correct on this, but with the run that tech has had, it's hard not to want to do a bit of profit-taking," said Ameriprise's Betz.According to preliminary data, the S&P 500 lost 4.52 points, or 0.10%, to end at 4,464.31 points, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 73.83 points, or 0.54%, to 13,647.20. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 105.52 points, or 0.30%, to 35,281.67.U.S. consumer sentiment dipped in August, yet Americans were optimistic that inflation will edge lower over the next year and beyond, according to a preliminary reading of a University of Michigan survey.Amid the major S&P sectors, healthcare and energy sectors advanced. Both have been among the worst performing industries this year, although energy matched its strongest run this year by closing higher for the seventh straight session.The energy sector's increase was aided by crude prices rising on forecasts for tightening supplies from the International Energy Agency. Occidental Petroleum Corp was among the biggest gainers, after one of its units secured a grant from the U.S. government to support its carbon capture ambitions.Among other movers, News Corp rose after the Rupert Murdoch-owned media conglomerate beat quarterly profit estimates, thanks to its cost-cutting efforts.U.S.-listed shares of Chinese companies Alibaba and JD.com fell as Beijing's latest stimulus measures disappointed investors, while fresh data showed that the country's post-pandemic recovery was losing steam.(Reporting by Bansari Mayur Kamdar and Johann M Cherian in Bengaluru and David French in New York; Additional reporting by Shashwat Chauhan; Editing by Vinay Dwivedi and David Gregorio)

Text Content: (Reuters) -Fox Corp said on Friday that Chief Legal Officer Viet Dinh was stepping down, a high-profile exit that follows its $787.5 million settlement in April of a defamation lawsuit filed by Dominion Voting Systems over its 2020 U.S. election coverage.Dinh, who will exit the role at the end of 2023, joined Fox in 2018 and headed its legal and compliance divisions during the months-long legal battle sparked by the network's coverage of false claims that Dominion rigged the election.The move marks another major departure at the network since the settlement. Top-rated host Tucker Carlson agreed to part ways with Fox in April, just days after the legal resolution.As part of a separation agreement, Dinh will get a lump-sum cash payment of $23 million, Fox said. He will become a special adviser to the company after leaving the role of legal head.He was a former U.S. attorney general under President George W Bush and an architect of the Patriot Act, the U.S. national security law enacted after the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.He founded Bancroft PLLC, a small Washington, D.C.-based litigation firm known for advocating conservative causes that was acquired by Kirkland & Ellis in 2016. Dinh's clients as a defense lawyer included billionaire real estate developer Ng Lap Seng, who was convicted of bribery in 2017.In June, Fox Corp also settled a lawsuit by former Fox News producer Abby Grossberg, who claimed gender discrimination and accused the network's lawyers of pressuring her to make misleading statements in the Dominion Voting Systems case.(Reporting by Chavi Mehta in Bengaluru and David Thomas in Chicago; Editing by Anil D'Silva and Shilpi Majumdar)

Text Content: Aug 11 (Reuters) - Private jet company Wheels Up Experience is in talks with lenders about a debt restructuring while exploring other options to avoid bankruptcy, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday.The company, which offers flight charters, has recently started discussions with Bain Capital and MSD Capital, holders of more than $260 million in equipment financing notes, after missing recent debt payments, the report added, citing people familiar with the matter.Wheels Up, Bain Capital and MSD Capital did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report.The New York-based company on Wednesday said there was "substantial doubt" about its ability to continue operations, even as it disclosed short-term funding from Delta Air Lines .Delta said in a statement that it was providing a short-term capital infusion in the form of a secured promissory note to Wheels Up, which is pursuing strategic partnerships. It did not disclose the amount of funding.Wheels Up has taken a slew of restructuring measures this year including job cuts and management changes as private jet traffic, which soared on demand from wealthy travelers during the pandemic, has slowed.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Overall inflation rates may be slowing across Europe, but the price of ingredients to make traditional dishes in France and Spain highlights how the worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation is still raging.Bloomberg’s custom index showed French households had to spend 8.4% more last month to prepare a coq au vin than a year earlier. Data from the country’s National Statistics Office and the Ministry of Agriculture and Nutrition put the total cost at €19.4 ($21.3).The price of poultry, which is the most expensive ingredient in the dish, rose 6.4%, while butter was up 16.5% from July last year.That contrasts with headline inflation of 4.3% in the euro area’s second-biggest economy, based on the national measure for consumer-price growth.A separate Bloomberg gauge showed that making paella, Spain’s national dish, was 15.1% more expensive in July than a year ago due to an almost 40% jump in the cost of olive oil, according to data from the National Statistics Institute.The country has been experiencing a devastating drought that has more than halved production.Headline inflation in Spain is among the lowest in the euro zone, easing earlier last year after the government set a cap on surging power prices. As favorable base effects start to fade in the second half of 2023, inflation will likely pick up to average 3.2% this year, according to the Bank of Spain.The cost of olive oil is also impacting Italy, where Bloomberg’s Pizza Margherita Index surged 13.5% this month.This story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: Aug 11 (Reuters) - The union representing striking Hollywood writers said on Friday it had received a counterproposal from the studios that it would consider, an apparent sign of progress in the more than 100-day-old strike.The Writers Guild of America (WGA) said it would respond next week "after deliberation" on the offer from the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which negotiates on behalf of companies including Walt Disney and Netflix .Both sides met on Aug. 4 to discuss resuming talks and the issues each intended to bring to the bargaining table, but the WGA afterwards criticized the studios in a sign the talks were strained.The strike by Hollywood writers began on May 2 after talks between the WGA and the major studios reached an impasse over compensation, minimum staffing of writers' rooms and residual payments in the streaming era, among other issues.Actors represented by the Screen Actors Guild went on strike on July 14 also over pay and artificial intelligence, effectively halting production of scripted television shows and films and affecting businesses throughout the entertainment world's orbit. It is the first time both unions have gone on strike since 1960. (Reporting by Chandni Shah in Bengaluru; Editing by William Mallard)

Text Content: By Svea Herbst-BaylissNEW YORK (Reuters) - Several prominent investors including hedge fund Baupost Group and mutual fund giant Fidelity bought or increased their holdings in retailer Amazon.com during the second quarter as its stock surge helped fuel Wall Street's rally.Baupost Group owned 963,946 shares in Amazon on June 30, according to a regulatory filing made late on Friday. Soros Fund Management owned 769,061 Amazon shares at the end of the second quarter, representing an increase of more than 8% in its holdings. And Senator Investment Group boosted its ownership by 35% to hold 440,000 shares at the end of the quarter, their filing showed.Amazon's stock price boomed during the pandemic when homebound shoppers relied on the retailer for toilet paper, groceries and much more. Then the share price tumbled 50% last year as many technology companies announced cuts and their stock prices skidded lower.Since January, Amazon's stock price has surged 61% and it is one of a small number of stocks powering the S&P 500 index's 17% gain this year after a 20% drop last year.Friday's filings are made by money managers to detail how much they owned in U.S. companies at the end of the second quarter. They are made public with a 45 day lag and while they are backward looking many investors scour them for trends.Mutual fund giant Fidelity, long a big owner of Amazon, increased its holdings by 1% to own 280,451,570 shares at the end of the second quarter, their filing showed. The filing did not break down which funds bought the shares.Investor GQG Partners LLC reported making a new investment and owning 15,476,122 shares at the end of the quarter.Asset managers must make their so-called 13-F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission by the end of business on August 14 and the bulk of filings will become public on Monday.What investors who bought Amazon during the second quarter did not know yet was how well the company fared during those three months. It reported an 11% gain in second quarter revenue and topped analysts' expectations when it reported earnings earlier this month. Management also pointed to a strong third quarter and the stock price rose on the earnings report.(Reporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss with additional reporting by Carolina Mandl; Editing by David Gregorio)

Text Content: CHICAGO (AP) — Illinois is the first state in the U.S. to ensure child social media influencers are compensated for their work, according to Sen. David Koehler, of Peoria, who sponsored a bill that was signed into law and will go into effect on July 1, 2024."The rise of social media has given children new opportunities to earn a profit,” Koehler said in an emailed press release after the bill was signed Friday afternoon. “Many parents have taken this opportunity to pocket the money, while making their children continue to work in these digital environments.”The idea for the law, which covers children under the age of 16 featured in monetized online platforms, including video blogs (also known as vlogs), was brought to Koehler by a 15-year-old in his district, the Democratic senator said.Besides coordinated dances and funny toddler comments, family vlogs nowadays may share intimate details of their children’s lives — grades, potty training, illnesses, misbehaviors, first periods — for countless strangers to view. Brand deals featuring the internet's darlings can reap tens of thousands of dollars per video, but so far there are minimal regulations for the “sharenthood” industry, which experts say can cause serious harm to children.“Videos with kids do really well,” said Bobbi Althoff, a TikToker with more than 5 million followers who used to feature her young daughter in paid advertising, but has since decided not to for privacy reasons.Many states already require parents to set aside earnings for child entertainers who perform in more traditional settings such as movies and television, but Illinois' law will be the first to specifically target social media starlets, according to Landon Jacquinot, who is tracking child labor legislation for the National Conference of State Legislatures.“We could see other states looking into doing something similar, especially in states that have a high volume of family vloggers and social media influencers,” such as California and New York, Jacquinot said. “It's kind of a new world.”Story continuesThe Illinois law will entitle child influencers to a percentage of earnings based on how often they appear on video blogs or online content that generates at least 10 cents per view. To qualify, the content must be created in Illinois, and kids would have to be featured in at least 30% of the content in a 30-day period.Video bloggers — or vloggers — would be responsible for maintaining records of kids’ appearances and must set aside gross earnings for the child in a trust account for when they turn 18; otherwise, the child can sue.Children "deserve to be shielded from parents who would attempt to take advantage of their child’s talents and use them for their own financial gain,” said Alex Gough, a spokesperson for Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, after the governor signed the legislation.Shreya Nallamothu, the teen who brought her concerns to Koehler and set the legislation in motion, first zeroed in on the issue while scrolling through social media during quarantine three years ago.“I realized that there’s a lot of exploitation that can happen within the world of ‘kidfluencing,’” said Nallamothu, now 16. “And I realized that there was absolutely zero legislation in place to protect them.”She clarified that the law is not meant for parents who share photos of their kids on social media for family and friends, or even those who post a viral video. “This is for families who make their income off of child vlogging and family vlogging,” she said.Lawmakers in Illinois, where Democrats hold a supermajority, passed the bill in May with bipartisan support.Other Democratic-led states have made efforts to regulate the child influencer industry with less success. A 2018 California child labor bill included a social media provision that was removed by the time it was passed. Washington state’s 2023 bill — spearheaded by Chris McCarty, another teen and the founder of Quit Clicking Kids, an advocacy organization focused on protecting minors being monetized online — stalled out in committee.“I sincerely hope that this momentum continues in other states and eventually nationwide,” McCarty said Friday about the Illinois law.But several Republican-led states this year have instead loosened child labor laws to help alleviate workforce shortages. An Iowa law signed at the end of May allows teenagers to work more jobs and for longer hours, and Arkansas in March eliminated permits that required employers to verify a child’s age and a parent’s consent.___Savage is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

Text Content: (Adds USDOT confirmation, details of agreement, Chinese flight proposed, Chinese embassy comment)By David ShepardsonWASHINGTON, Aug 11 (Reuters) - The U.S. and China will approve twice the number of passenger flights currently permitted for air carriers to fly between the two countries, the Biden administration said on Friday, in a rare sign of cooperation between the world's largest two economies.The U.S. Transportation Department (USDOT) said it would will increase the number of Chinese passenger flights allowed to fly to the U.S. to 18 weekly round-trips on Sept. 1 and increase that to 24 per week starting Oct. 29 , up from the current 12.It said the Chinese government will agree to the same increase for American carriers, confirming a decision reported earlier by Reuters.The agreement between Beijing and Washington, which have sparred on many fronts, comes after China on Thursday lifted pandemic-era restrictions on group tours for more countries, including key markets such as the U.S., Japan, South Korea and Australia.USDOT said the first tranche of flights was approved to start Sept. 1 "to meet an anticipated increase in demand around the start of the academic year."Sources said U.S. airlines are not expected to immediately take advantage of all 18 weekly flights.The Chinese Embassy in Washington referred questions about specifics to authorities in China, but said "direct flights are essential for increasing mutual visits between Chinese and American peoples. We hope that the restoration of more flights will do good to the flow of people and trade between the two countries."After Secretary of State Antony Blinken's June trip to the China, consistent engagement by USDOT and the State Department with Chinese officials "made this important step forward possible," USDOT added."Our overriding goal is an improved environment wherein the carriers of both parties are able to exercise fully their bilateral rights to maintain a competitive balance and fair and equal opportunity among U.S. and Chinese air carriers," USDOT said in its approval order on Friday.Story continuesAir China said in a filing with USDOT on Thursday that it was seeking permission to add a new weekly flight between Beijing and Los Angeles.China Eastern, Xiamen Airlines and China Southern also fly scheduled service to the U.S., while United Airlines, American Airlines and Delta Airlines currently operate passenger flights to China.United said on Friday it willexpand flightsbetween the two countries under the agreement, resuming flights to Beijing and reintroducing its daily service to Shanghai.Airlines for America, an industry trade group, said it "supports the gradual reopening of U.S.-China air services commiserate with increases in passenger demand over time. Today’s modified Order ensures fair and equal opportunity for U.S. airlines to compete in the marketplace."The 24 weekly flights are still a fraction of the more than 150 round-trip flights allowed by each side before restrictions were imposed in early 2020 due to the COVID-pandemic.On May 3, USDOT said it would allow Chinese airlines to increase U.S. passenger services to 12 weekly round-trips, equal to the number of flights Beijing has permitted for American carriers. Previously, only eight weekly flights by Chinese carriers were allowed.U.S. carriers have noted that they cannot fly over Russian airspace to China, which makes some routes much longer. Reuters reported in June Chinese airlines were avoiding flying over Russian airspace in newly approved flights to and from the U.S. but still using Russian airspace for other flights.

Text Content: By Lewis KrauskopfNEW YORK (Reuters) -Stock investors have been satisfied by middling U.S. corporate results so far this year but they might not be so easy to please for the rest of 2023.As the second-quarter earnings season winds down, S&P 500 results are presenting a mixed picture, with companies beating analysts' profit expectations at the highest rate in nearly two years even as revenue beats dropped to the lowest since early 2020.Investors appear content with that, for now. The S&P 500 has edged higher since earnings season began in July, with the benchmark index up 16% in 2023. But expectations call for corporate profits to pick up as the U.S. economy has so far defied recession fears, and investors may be far less forgiving if companies fail to deliver later this year, given the jump in equity valuations."Markets are expecting earnings to ... deliver above and beyond where they have been," said Eric Freedman, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Asset Management. "This is a market that has moved up in anticipation of earnings that we have not quite gotten yet."Overall, second-quarter earnings are expected to have fallen 3.8% from a year earlier, Refinitiv IBES data showed. That decline follows a 0.1% rise in the first quarter and a 3.2% drop in the fourth quarter of last year.Results are expected to improve, however. Third-quarter S&P 500 earnings are seen rising 1.3% on a year-over-year basis, according to Refinitiv, before a 9.7% fourth-quarter earnings rise and a 11.9% full-year increase in 2024.Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has become more richly valued. The index was trading at 19.1 times forward 12-month earnings estimates as of Thursday, compared to its long-term average of 15.6 times, according to Refinitiv Datastream. The P/E ratio ended 2022 at just below 17 times.This year's valuation expansion accounted for 86% of the S&P 500's year-to-date return through July, with the rest of the market's boost coming from positive changes to earnings estimates, an analysis by Credit Suisse equity strategists showed.Story continues"At this point, valuations have run ahead of the fundamentals and so companies now have to prove that they can generate earnings growth," said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial.Q2 RESULTSWith 91% of S&P 500 companies having reported second-quarter results, 78.7% posted earnings above analysts' expectations, according to Refinitiv IBES. In aggregate, companies are reporting earnings 7.7% above expectations, up from a long-term average of 4.1% above estimates. Both the beat rate and surprise factor are coming in at their highest rates since the third quarter of 2021.However, for revenue, only 62.9% of companies have topped expectations - the lowest beat rate since the first quarter of 2020.Stock reaction to earnings results has also been tepid, with share prices posting weaker responses to both beats and misses than the average over the past five years, analyst Julian Emanuel of Evercore ISI said. The average stock fell 0.6% after results in the second quarter, Emanuel said in a note on Thursday."We went from a market that is saying, 'Earnings had to back it up' to 'Thankfully earnings didn't screw this up,'" said John Lynch, chief investment officer for Comerica Wealth Management. "That just gets us into a more expensive realm."Meanwhile, there have also been some high profile disappointments, with Apple shares dropping 4.8% after the iPhone maker's weak sales forecast. Other megacap companies, such as Amazon and Alphabet, have seen a positive investor response to their reports.Companies reporting results next week include key retailers, such as Walmart and Home Depot, while the release of monthly retail sales on Tuesday also could influence markets.While investors generally have turned more positive about the economic outlook, some still are wary of a recession stemming from the delayed impact of higher interest rates, as indicators such as the Treasury yield curve are still flashing warning signs. Such a downturn could severely change the prospects for corporate earnings and potentially weigh on valuations. During recessions, earnings fall at a 24% annual rate on average, according to Ned Davis Research. "There is optimism, but I still wonder going into next year, are we too optimistic, from a consensus standpoint," said Comerica's Lynch. "Just because we didn't have a recession this year, that yield curve continues to point to one."(Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Richard Chang)

It also marks a premium of about 43% to the closing price of Chindata shares before the initial approach was made public.U.S.-listed shares of Chindata, which operates data centers in China, India and Southeast Asia, rose 3% after the bell.Data centers operators have enjoyed a surge in demand in recent years as more businesses take to the web. They also stand to benefit from this year's rise of artificial intelligence services such as ChatGPT, which require massive computing power.Bain Capital, which took Chindata public on the Nasdaq in September 2020, said earlier this year it will not sell any of its shares in the company after it received a bid from China Merchants Capital for $3.4 billion.The go-private deal announced on Friday will be funded through a combination of cash and debt financing provided by Shanghai Pudong Development Bank, Chindata said. It is expected to close during the fourth quarter of 2023 or early next year.(Reporting by Manya Saini in Bengaluru; Editing by Shinjini Ganguli)

Text Content: *Zolgensma launched as possible "cure," now outcomes paint nuanced picture*Positive results, but add-on therapies increasing, neurologists say*Once world's priciest drug, that raises questions for other gene therapiesBy Deena BeasleyLOS ANGELES, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Baby Ben Kutschke was diagnosed at three months with spinal muscular atrophy, a rare inherited disorder which is the leading genetic cause of death in infancy globally. It leaves children too weak to walk, talk, swallow or even breathe.So when in 2021 his parents heard about Zolgensma – a one-time therapy costing millions of dollars that promises to replace genes needed for the body to control muscles – they had high hopes.They were disappointed.After treatment with the $2.25 million therapy at almost eight months old, Ben was able to hold his head up for a few seconds – a significant milestone, his mother Elizabeth Kutschke told Reuters. But he did not advance to rolling over or sitting up, and after a few weeks doctors recommended the family add another drug to help him."I just started to worry," she said from their home in Berwyn, Illinois. "He wasn't getting worse, but the gradual progress we had seen ... was no longer happening."Ben is one of a growing number of patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) whose doctors are turning to additional drugs on top of the gene therapy, six top U.S. neurologists told Reuters.Their experience raises broader questions around other high-cost gene therapies coming to market, sometimes after accelerated regulatory approvals, drug pricing experts said.Zolgensma, launched in 2019 by Swiss-based healthcare group Novartis as a "potential cure" for SMA, was the most expensive drug in the world at the time.Gene therapies work by replacing genes – the body's blueprint for its development. The gene Zolgensma delivers instructs the body to make a protein vital for muscle control.Story continuesOther SMA therapies need to be taken continuously, but Zolgensma's price was justified by hopes this revolutionary approach could beat the condition once and for all.Zolgensma has been given to more than 3,000 children globally, with 2022 sales of $1.4 billion representing 91% of gene therapy sales worldwide, according to the IQVIA Institute for Human Data Science. In the U.S., where costs are borne by government health programs such as Medicaid as well as private insurance, IQVIA estimated Zolgensma sales totaled $434 million last year.It has worked well for many. Novartis' data presented in March shows that depending on the timing of treatment, most patients have gone on to swallow, breathe, or even walk independently, said Sitra Tauscher-Wisniewski, vice president at Novartis Gene Therapies. Some are able to run and climb.Three of six families interviewed by Reuters whose children received Zolgensma said they were progressing as well as hoped; Ben's was the only one to turn to another treatment.But Novartis' data also shows almost one-third of children in an ongoing study went on to be given other drugs.If gene therapies do fall short, it becomes harder to justify prices that researchers have argued are already poor value."The perception that Zolgensma is going to be a complete cure ... is not coming to fruition from the data we have seen over the last four years," said Dr. Roger Hajjar, director of the Mass General Brigham Gene & Cell Therapy Institute."Following the injection of Zolgensma you are basically going from a deadly disease to a more chronic disease state," he said, adding that many patients would not survive without this treatment.Novartis said Zolgensma has been "transformative," but each child's journey is unique and outcomes can vary. It says there is no evidence additional therapies can help. Notably, it has dropped the term "potentially curative" – common in its analyst calls in 2018 and 2019 – from descriptions of Zolgensma, instead calling it a "one-time treatment.""People still have misconceptions about Zolgensma," Kutschke told Reuters. "It is a treatment, not a cure."IN THE PIPELINENovartis CEO Vasant Narasimhan spelled out the pricing argument in a 2018 call: "Payers appreciate that when you deliver a potentially curative therapy that takes cost out of their healthcare system and enables people to live, hopefully, a more normal life, they are willing to pay and they see the value," he said.The multimillion-dollar pricing strategy is not unique. More recently, the first hemophilia gene therapy approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration was priced by CSL Behring at $3.5 million; 26 more gene therapies are in late-stage development, according to IQVIA.Drugmakers say the long-term benefits are worth it. CSL said it is confident that its treatment can generate cost savings and has offered partial refunds if patients need to resume injections of blood-clotting proteins in the first four years after the therapy.Novartis offers payment by installments – although it said no one in the U.S. has taken them. It also has plans linking payment to how well a patient responds, but said U.S. refunds under them have been rare.The economics of treating the relatively small number of patients make a high price tag imperative for manufacturers."One of the arguments is you're saving all of these millions of dollars down the line," said Stacie Dusetzina, professor of health policy at Nashville's Vanderbilt University School of Medicine."But if you found out later on that oh, actually you have to get most of those other treatments, I think the question is, 'was that price really a fair price to begin with?'"The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER), a drug pricing research group, has said Zolgensma's maximum price should be $900,000 – less than half its current cost.The two other available SMA treatments are also not cheap.Biogen's Spinraza, injected into the spine, has a U.S. list price of $800,000 in the first year followed by maintenance doses at $400,000 a year. Roche's Evrysdi, an oral solution, costs $100,000 to $340,000 per year depending on how much the patient weighs.Both Biogen and Roche said studies of their drugs as treatments for patients who do not respond sufficiently to Zolgensma have been encouraging so far. Biogen's Chief Medical Officer Maha Radhakrishnan said a second drug could still add value given the high cost of caring for severely disabled patients.The fact that some children need treatment with other expensive drugs after Zolgensma shows that the gene therapy represents "poor value," said Steven Pearson, ICER president.It's a headache for health insurers, who usually cover the full cost of Zolgensma upfront: It's not yet clear how to manage a payment plan over time, and that would require more real-world data on how patients respond, said Sree Chaguturu, chief medical officer at CVS Health, which owns health insurer Aetna."How long do you actually need to monitor and track those patients?" he said, noting that Americans commonly move between different insurance plans."DOING AMAZING"Many parents of children with SMA say Zolgensma is worth it.Amanda Cook, a 32-year-old bookkeeper in Lebanon, Virginia, already knew when she gave birth to her son Weston in 2021 that he was diagnosed with SMA: It had led to the death of his older brother, Jackson, at 7 months.Weston had a flaw in the gene that produces a protein critical to the function of cells that move muscles. The lack of that protein, known as SMN (survival motor neuron), results in SMA, which affects fewer than 300 babies a year in the United States.But he had Zolgensma at 11 days old and "is ahead of everything, honestly," Cook said.All therapies have been stopped and he is "doing amazing as a true 2-year old."The treatment works best when infused as soon as possible after birth – some patients can begin to suffer from degeneration before birth – and Ben Kutschke was a relative latecomer.His parents saw him having problems when he was about a month old. Formula spilled from the corners of his mouth. He couldn't hold a pacifier; his doctor suggested they try different sizes but it became clear his condition was serious when Elizabeth heard liquid slipping down his windpipe.Ben was found, like about 60% of cases, to have the most severe form of SMA which often leads to paralysis and death before age two."The earlier and better preserved the nerves are, the more likely you are to have success," said Dr. Jerry Mendell, director of the gene therapy center at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio and principal investigator in the Zolgensma trials.Zolgensma is becoming available to younger babies across the U.S.: Most states screen newborns for it, and health insurers typically cover Zolgensma for children with the most severe form.ANTIBODIESBut even after diagnosis, not all children are immediate candidates.Zolgensma delivers the gene through a modified virus. Ben had already been exposed to the virus in nature and had developed antibodies, which would neutralize the replacement genes in his body.Dr. Russell Butterfield, pediatric neurologist, University of Utah Health and Intermountain Primary Children's Hospital, said it's "not all that rare" for babies to have antibodies to the vector. He put the incidence at 15% to 20%.Babies can also be ineligible due to issues such as liver problems – Zolgensma's label warns it can cause these. Last year, two children in Russia and Kazakhstan died of acute liver failure several weeks after receiving it.Ben was originally treated with Evrysdi, which aims to boost SMN levels directly. It took months for his antibody levels to fall to the point he could start Zolgensma."When they did say the antibodies were down, oh I cried on that phone call," Kutschke said.When he finally received Zolgensma, Ben's hand movements became smoother and he was able to lift his head, "but then after that big rocket forward in progress, it seemed to just stall out," his mother said.The body develops antibodies to the virus used, so each therapy using it can only be administered once. Doctors recommended a third treatment, Biogen's Spinraza."REAL LIFE"The most recent Novartis data, updated in March, shows this was not unusual. Its study found that 24 of 81 children given Zolgensma as of May 2022 had been subsequently treated with other SMA drugs. Novartis declined to provide details on them."There are a whole lot of things that happen in real life circumstances" to affect the utility of treatment with Zolgensma, Mendell said. For less responsive patients, Mendell said it is reasonable to use other treatments.But it can be difficult to get insurance coverage after Zolgensma. Some health plans explicitly exclude add-on therapies if a child received it, according to policies posted on their websites.Kutschke said her insurance company UMR, part of UnitedHealth Group, balked at reimbursing another drug. A spokesperson for UnitedHealth declined to comment.Kutschke said UMR reasoned that Ben "should be fine" after getting Zolgensma – "Which is really heartbreaking because we thought he would be too."It took nearly six months of paperwork and appeals – supported by Ben's medical team – before payment for Spinraza was approved.Since then Ben, who now uses a wheelchair at age 2, began talking a lot more. He was suddenly able to move his lower body, his mother said. (Additional reporting by Eric Cox in Chicago; Edited by Caroline Humer and Sara Ledwith)

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- On a balmy July weekend, a sea of purple and blue tents stretched across a field in Belgium, providing temporary shelter for nearly 4,000 music lovers from all over the globe. Recycled from abandoned camp gear, the colorful patchwork was part of a push by Tomorrowland, one of Europe’s biggest festivals, to scale back its carbon footprint.“It’s not only about reducing the huge carbon footprint all at once,” said Lori Maes, a coordinator at Belgium-based Camp2Camp, which provided tents and rented out secondhand sleeping bags, air mattresses and chairs to festival goers. “It’s about making efforts that, combined together, can make a difference.”With much of the world baking in extreme heat this summer, there’s been a renewed focus on the environmental impact of the concert industry. From Britain’s Glastonbury Festival to Coachella in California, event organizers are focusing more than ever on sustainability by planting trees, banning single-use plastic bottles and even ensuring that face glitter is biodegradable.Festivals are like “living laboratories because you can try something one year, then you can evaluate, and the following year you can try something new,” said Holger Jan Schmidt, general secretary at Yourope - The European Festival Association. “Festivals can also act as a motivator given that they appeal to a large group of young people.”Held for two weekends each summer in the Belgian town of Boom, Tomorrowland draws roughly 400,000 fans of electronic dance music from over 200 countries. Tapio, a Brussels-based consultancy, estimates that the festival emits almost 150,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent due to the air travel, merchandise and food involved. That’s roughly on par with the annual emissions footprint of 9,300 Belgians.Story continuesThis year, efforts to improve sustainability were evident across Tomorrowland’s sprawling site, which played host to 16 stages and some 750 musical acts. The festival expanded its electricity grid in order to halve its use of diesel generators, and affiliated nonprofit Love Tomorrow staged a parallel conference with workshops to discuss sustainability.The festival had a strong focus on recycling, with purple bins that let attendees sort food, plastics and general waste. Employees and volunteers also collected refuse in bins strapped to their backs, and some food stalls experimented with edible straws and cups. Campers who brought sorted waste to a collection area were eligible for prizes that included earplugs, reusable water bottles and socks made from recycled yarns.“Climate change is everywhere, and we are trying our best,” said Sarah Campbell, a festival goer from Ireland who stayed in Tomorrowland’s village, known as Dreamville. “But you can’t rob yourself of life and experiences. If every single person here recycles their cups, it makes already a huge difference.”Tomorrowland is tackling some of its environmental pitfalls head-on: According to Tapio, 21% of the festival’s emissions come from sales of meals, beverages, merchandise and other goods. But 79% of Tomorrowland emissions are associated with transportation, where reductions are more difficult. The festival received criticism for a tie-in with Brussels Airlines that included 10,500 flight packages, some of them “party flights” with live DJ sets.“Tomorrowland means the land of tomorrow,” said Tapio Chief Executive Officer Louis Collinet. “But this land will not exist if we do not take into account the climate impact.”Tomorrowland spokesperson Debby Wilmsen pointed to the festival’s international nature as a big factor in its transportation footprint. “If we do not provide for a flight for people to come, festival goers would still book a flight, just with another company,” she said.Read More: From Coldplay to Massive Attack, Music Tours Try to Go GreenTomorrowland also disputes the findings of the Tapio report, which Wilmsen says were drawn “without any facts or insights from our side.” The festival is hiring a consultancy to do a separate assessment, with plans to publish data later this year. Tapio, which creates carbon-reduction plans for businesses, says its findings are more “symbolic” than exact.Many festivals are looking for ways to reduce emissions. The Paradise City Festival in Belgium partnered with local company Aquafin to treat wastewater from toilets so it can be released back into nature. Dutch festival Lowlands, which hosts about 60,000 alternative music fans each year, partnered with developer Solarfields to put solar panel roofing over a 35-hectare parking lot.Glastonbury, with a capacity of 210,000, was fully powered by renewable energy this year. The festival committed to monitoring the quality of water in local rivers and has planted more than 10,000 native trees and hedges directly. Coachella has a prize draw for festival goers who organize carpools and requires all food vendors to use compostable plates, cups and utensils.“Music festivals are like a mini town, in some cases even a mini city because of their scale,” said Teresa Moore, director of the environmental nonprofit A Greener Future, who thinks future legislation could force festivals to make more progress. “Those events who are already making these changes are ahead of the game. Those who have not started need to get going, because otherwise they will find themselves running to catch up.”©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: (Recast throughout with details, background)Aug 11 (Reuters) - Electric-truck maker Nikola said on Friday it was recalling about 209 battery-powered electric trucks and suspending sales after an investigation into recent fires found a coolant leak inside a battery pack as the cause.The preliminary findings of the probe by a third-party investigator were corroborated on Thursday by a "minor thermal incident" on one pack on a parked engineering-validation truck, the company said, adding that no one was injured."Foul play or other external factors were unlikely to have caused the incident," Nikola said in a statement, adding efforts were underway to provide a remedy.The company had said it suspected foul play when it started an investigation in June after trucks at its Phoenix, Arizona, headquarters caught fire. One damaged truck, kept at the Phoenix site for monitoring, reignited last month.Internal investigations from Nikola's safety and engineering teams indicate a single supplier component within the battery pack as the likely source of the coolant leak that caused the vehicles to catch fire, the company said.Struggling with supply chain bottlenecks and weaker demand, Nikola decided to make battery electric trucks only to order and focus on hydrogen fuel cell trucks.Nikola on Aug. 4 appointed Chairman Stephen Girsky, a former General Motors executive, as its chief executive, its fourth in four years.The company flagged "substantial doubts" about its ability to continue as a going concern for the next 12 months, reiterating its warning for the third time since February, as it awaits "critical" additional capital.On Friday, Nikola asked customers and dealers of its Tre battery electric trucks to take certain immediate safety measures, including considering parking them outside.Nikola's shares fell as much as 5.6% after the close.(Reporting by Shubhendu Deshmukh and Mrinmay Dey in Bengaluru and Abhirup Roy in San Francisco; Editing by Sandra Maler and William Mallard)

Text Content: (Reuters) - Wynn Resorts is winding down its online sports betting and iGaming platform, WynnBET, in certain U.S. states due to a lack of clear rules and higher customer acquisition costs, the casino operator said on Friday.The company said it was ceasing operations in Arizona, Colorado, Indiana, Louisiana, New Jersey, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia. The decision to pull out of West Virginia comes a couple of months after it launched WynnBet in the state.Wynn, however, said operations in Nevada and Massachusetts will continue unaffected, while those in New York and Michigan remain under review.Wynn Chief Financial Officer Julie Cameron-Doe cited the dearth of iGaming legislation and the continued requirement for outsized marketing spend in online sports betting for the decision.Shares of the company were down about 4% in afternoon trade.WynnBET is part of the company's majority-owned subsidiary, Wynn Interactive, which was expected to merge with Austerlitz Acquisition Corp I. The deal, however, was terminated in November 2021.On Wednesday, Wynn Resorts posted second-quarter results above Wall Street estimates, as its Las Vegas and Macau properties saw growth in gaming, dining and hotel bookings.(Reporting by Ananya Mariam Rajesh in Bengaluru; Editing by Pooja Desai and Anil D'Silva)

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- VinFast Auto Ltd. soared on its first day in the public markets, boosting the fortune of its billionaire founder.The electric automaker’s shares surged 175% as of 1:19 p.m. in New York, adding $30.3 billion to the net worth of chairman Pham Nhat Vuong. The fortune of Vietnam’s richest man now stands at $37.1 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.The index hasn’t previously included Vuong’s stake in the carmaker, which he founded. He directly and indirectly controls 99% of the company’s outstanding shares, mostly through his conglomerate, Vingroup JSC. That large stake limits the shares available for other investors to trade, meaning the stock is prone to large swings.VinFast scrapped its plans for a normal initial public offering and opted for a SPAC listing after investor appetite for money-losing startups waned over the past year. Instead, it agreed to merge with blank-check company Black Spade Acquisition Co., founded by casino mogul Lawrence Ho.The company was established by Vuong in 2017, and forecasts sales will reach 45,000 to 50,000 this year. It began building a factory in North Carolina last month. Vuong and his relatives have invested at least $300 million into the automaker.Vuong moved to Ukraine in the early 1990s after studying geo-economic engineering in Russia. He started a business making instant noodles which was sold to Nestle SA in 2010, nine years after he had returned to Vietnam.By that time, he’d already established publicly-traded Vingroup JSC, focused on real estate, resorts, schools, shopping malls and more. The Hanoi-based firm booked revenue of $4.4 billion last year, and remains a major shareholder in VinFast.Story continuesIf VinFast can hold onto its gains, it will be in a somewhat unique position given the dismal performance of other electric automakers taken public via SPACs, including Lordstown Motors Corp., Nikola Corp. and Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc., all of which lost more than 90% of their market value since their mergers.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Stocks slumped as investor debate shifts toward how long the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates elevated. US bonds gained as investors bought the dip.The S&P 500 fell 0.7% while the Nasdaq 100 slid 0.6% after US retail sales rose more than forecast, data that suggested the economy can support higher rates and may dissuade policy makers from pivoting to easier policy. Financials weighed on the broader benchmark after a warning from Fitch that the ratings firm may downgrade larger lenders like JPMorgan Chase & Co. or Bank of America Corp. while Discover Financial Services was the worst performer after its chief executive officer resigned.In earnings, Home Depot Inc. beat the average analyst estimate, suggesting that US home improvement spending is performing slightly better than expected following an unprecedented boom during the pandemic. More insight into the state of the consumer will come later this week when Target Corp. and Walmart Inc. are set to report.Investors are growing wary that consumer-facing companies will be able to maintain their pricing power for much longer as the lagged effects of the Fed’s policy tightening take hold.“Eventually — and I think we’ll see some of that now — those margins get eaten away,” Bob Doll, chief investment officer at Crossmark Global Investments, told Bloomberg Television. “Because companies can only raise prices so far, and you’re already seeing consumers begin to make noise and balk and stop buying some things.”“We’ve been — since the first of the year — saying recession starts sometime between Labor Day and the end of the year,” he added. Doll is sticking with that prediction though he expects it to be a mild downturn.Story continuesUS Treasuries went higher as buyers stepped in amid a global bond selloff. Options traders have been recalibrating bets to accommodate the possibility that interest rates and inflation will stay high for longer.

Text Content: With two bidders revealed in a matter of days and more in the wings, United States Steel Corp. — a symbol of American industrialization that for more than a century helped build everything from the United Nations building in New York City to the New Orleans Superdome — appears be on the cusp of being absorbed.Here’s what's happened so far, and how the acquisition of U.S. Steel could reshape steelmaking globally.BIDDING WARAfter rejecting a $7.3 billion buyout proposal from rival Cleveland-Cliffs on Sunday, U.S. Steel said it was considering its next move. On Monday, industrial conglomerate Esmark offered $7.8 billion for the Pittsburgh steelmaker.Shares of U.S. Steel soared more than 30% Monday with good odds that bids for the 122-year-old steel producer will head higher.U.S. Steel says it has other offers to consider as well, and the company gave no timeline for if and when it might make any decision about selling itself.A POTENTIAL GIANTCleveland-Cliffs said its proposal, first made on July 28, would create a company that would be among the 10 biggest steelmakers in the world and one of the top four outside of China, which dominates global steel production. Cleveland-Cliffs CEO Lourenco Goncalves said a tie-up between the two U.S. steelmakers would create “lower-cost, more innovative and stronger domestic supplier for our customers.”Goncalves said he's ready to continue talks with U.S. Steel despite its rejection of the company's initial offer.Cleveland-Cliffs is the largest producer of flat-rolled steel and iron in North America. Acquiring U.S. Steel would further shrink the number of players in the U.S. steelmaking industry, which has experienced significant consolidation in recent years, including the two steelmakers at the center of developments this week.The proposed acquisition would give Cleveland-Cliffs control of about 50% of the domestic flat steel market and 100% of blast furnace production, Citi analysts wrote in a note to clients. It would also create “close to a domestic monopoly” on auto body sheet steel and close to 100% of U.S. iron ore.Story continuesThat will most certainly garner the interest of antitrust regulators who, under the Biden administration, have raised the bar for mergers in a number of industries. Automakers and other big buyers of steel will also likely push back over shrinking competition among U.S. steelmakers.SOARING STEEL PRICES AND CONSOLIDATIONSoaring prices have helped fuel consolidation in the steel industry in this decade. Steel prices more than quadrupled near the start of the pandemic to near $2,000 per metric ton by the summer of 2021 as supply chains experienced gridlock, a symptom of surging demand for goods and the lack of anticipation of that demand.Cleveland Cliffs acquired AK Steel in 2019 right before steel prices began to spike and within a year, it acquired ArcelorMittal USA in 2020 for $1.4 billion. U.S. Steel bought Big River Steel the following year.Prices have settled back to around $800 per metric ton, but that remains at the top end of the spectrum for steel prices over the past six years. An extended economic rebound, particularly in the U.S, has helped keep prices for flat-rolled steel elevated.U.S. STEEL HISTORYU.S. Steel has been a symbol of industrialization since it was founded in 1901 by J.P. Morgan, Andrew Carnegie and others, and the domestic steel industry dominated globally before Japan, then China, became the preeminent steelmakers over the past 40 years.The company survived the Great Depression and became an integral part of U.S. efforts in World War I and II, supplying hundreds of millions of tons of steel for planes, ships, tanks and other military gear, in addition to steel for automobiles and appliances.During the late 1970s and early 80s — amid an energy crisis and multiple recessions — U.S. Steel cut production and spun off many of its other businesses. With oversupply and an influx of lower-priced steel imports dragging down prices into the new century, the company reorganized in 2001 and separated its energy business, which became Marathon Oil Corp.The 64-story U.S. Steel Tower still looms over the Pittsburgh skyline, but U.S. Steel is no longer its biggest tenant. That would be UPMC, a local health system, and its name is now at the top of the tower.GLOBAL STEEL PRODUCTIONChina and Chinese companies have come to dominate global steel production. Of the nearly 2 billion tons of steel produced annually across the globe, about 54% comes from China, according to the World Steel Association.China's Baowu Group, a state-owned iron company based in Shanghai, churned out nearly 120 million metric tons of steel in 2021.Cleveland-Cliffs and U.S. Steel combined that year produced almost 33 metric tons of steel, according to the World Steel Association. The combined entity would vault immediately to a top 10 steelmaker globally, but it will still be at the lower end of that list.It would not alter the position of U.S. steelmaking as a whole, of course, which current ranks No. 4 behind China, India and Japan.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- US Representative Don Bacon said he is among those whose emails were hacked in an espionage campaign that Microsoft Corp. has attributed to China.Bacon, a Republican from Nebraska and a strong advocate for US military support to Taiwan, posted on social media that the FBI had notified him that the Chinese Communist Party hacked into his personal and campaign emails over the course of a month, from May 15 to June 16.“The CCP hackers utilized a vulnerability in the Microsoft software, and this was not due to ‘user error,’” he wrote on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter.Bacon, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, received an email from Microsoft indicating he may have been hacked and advising him to change his password on June 16, according to Maggie Sayers, Bacon’s press secretary.She said that following subsequent notification from the FBI that he had been hacked, Bacon determined emails relating to political strategy, fundraising and personal banking information may have been breached. As a former US Air Force intelligence officer, he is careful to avoid writing sensitive emails relating to China and Taiwan, she said.Last month, Microsoft reported that China-based actors gained access to email accounts affecting about 25 organizations including government agencies and consumer accounts of individuals likely associated with these groups for espionage purposes.US State Department has said it first noticed anomalous activity in June, in the weeks before Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Beijing to meet with top officials, including Chinese President Xi Jinping. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo was among the US officials whose emails were breached. The emails of Nicholas Burns, US ambassador to China, were also breached, according to the Wall Street Journal.Story continuesSenator Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, last month called for the US to investigate Microsoft’s role in the breach and hold the company “responsible for its negligent cybersecurity practices.”“Government emails were stolen because Microsoft committed another error,” Wyden said in a July 27 letter.Since then, the Department of Homeland Security announced that a US cybersecurity advisory panel will investigate malicious targeting of cloud computing environments. The panel will also look into Microsoft’s role in the recent breach.The review by the Cyber Safety Review Board, which was created by the Biden administration to investigate major cybersecurity events, will focus on approaches cloud service providers, the government and industry should employ to strengthen identity management and authentication in the cloud, according to DHS.The FBI didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. China’s Foreign Ministry has described claims about the hacking campaign as “false information”.Bacon posted on X that he would “work overtime” to ensure US weapons sales to Taiwan go ahead. The hack of Bacon’s emails was previously reported by the Washington Post.As for why he was hacked, Bacon wrote, “I stand against the Uighur genocide and abuses in Tibet and Hong Kong. And, I support an independent Taiwan.”©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: (Reuters) - Shares of Nvidia rose more than 3% in hefty trading volume on Tuesday after two brokerages raised their price targets for the chipmaker, heightening already lofty expectations ahead of its quarterly earnings report next week.The world's most valuable semiconductor company has been at the center of a rally in technology stocks this year, fueled by optimism about the potential of artificial intelligence and demand for components used to power the technology.Over $22 billion worth of Nvidia's shares were traded as of mid-day, beating out $14 billion of trades in Tesla, which is usually the Wall Street's most traded stock."They've got to blow it away. That's the bottom line. The bar is very high, and investors look like they're pushing the bar higher, even into the report," said Dennis Dick, a trader at Triple D Trading.Nvidia shares rose as much as 3.5% before trimming gains. They were last up 1.7% at $445, bringing gains this week to 9%.Nvidia was just one of three stocks in the Philadelphia semiconductor index trading higher on Tuesday after stronger-than-expected U.S. retail sales data stoked worries that interest rates could stay higher for longer, rattling the stock market."NVDA is quite literally serving as 'kingmaker' as a huge wave of capital and new financing vehicles are chasing new AI software and specialized cloud infrastructure models," UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri wrote in a research report.Ahead of Nvidia's fiscal second quarter report on Aug. 23, Arcuri lifted his price target to $540 from $475, while Wells Fargo increased its price target to $500 from $450. That came after Morgan Stanley on Monday named Nvidia its "top pick"."We think it's hard to bet against NVDA's pre-eminent positioning as the primary beneficiary of an AI-driven architectural data center transformation," Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers wrote in his research note.Story continuesNvidia's stock surged 24% on May 25 after the Santa Clara, California company gave a second-quarter revenue forecast more than 50% above Wall Street estimates due to demand for its AI chips, which are used to power ChatGPT and similar services.Analysts on average expect Nvidia to report a 66% surge in quarterly revenue to $11.13 billion, according to Refinitiv.

Source: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-us-natgas-futures-fall-190422007.html
Text Content: (Adds settlement price in paragraph 2) Aug 15 (Reuters) - U.S. natural gas futures fell 5% on Tuesday on forecasts for lower demand into next week along with relatively high output. Front-month gas futures for September delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange settled 13.6 cents, or 4.9% lower, at $2.659 per million British thermal units (mmBtu). The retreat in prices came despite expectations that a hotter-than-normal weather forecast until end-August, especially in Texas, would keep air conditioners humming, driving up power demand. "Gas is getting tugged lower by broad-based cut in risk appetite but extended hot weather forecasts are a downside limiter," analysts at Ritterbusch and Associates said in a note. Data provider Refinitiv forecast U.S. gas demand, including exports, would rise from 103.1 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) this week to 104.4 bcfd next week. But these numbers were lower from Monday's forecast. Refinitiv said average gas output in the Lower 48 states was 101.8 bcfd so far in August, nearly the same as the 101.8 bcfd in July, and not far from a monthly record of 102.2 bcfd in May. Gas flows to the seven big U.S. LNG export plants have fallen from an average of 12.7 bcfd in July to 12.4 bcfd so far in August, mainly due to reductions at Venture Global LNG's Calcasieu facility in Louisiana and Cheniere Energy's Corpus Christi, Texas facility. That compares with a monthly record of 14.0 bcfd in April. European gas prices rose, meanwhile, as concerns continued over possible strikes at Australian liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities. The Woodside and Chevron facilities manage nearly 11% of global LNG exports and a reduction in shipments could compel "Asian buyers to outbid their EU counterparts, likely turning to the US to secure adequate LNG cargoes", analysts at SEB group said in a note. The U.S. is on track to become the world's biggest LNG supplier in 2023 - ahead of recent leaders Australia and Qatar - as higher global prices feed demand for U.S. exports due to supply disruptions and sanctions linked to the war in Ukraine. In 2022, roughly 69%, or 7.2 bcfd, of U.S. LNG exports went to Europe as shippers diverted cargoes from Asia to get higher prices.

Text Content: (Reuters) - ChatGPT creator OpenAI made a strong case for the use of AI in content moderation, saying it can unlock efficiencies at social media firms by speeding up the time it takes to handle some of the grueling tasks.Despite the hype around generative AI, companies such as Microsoft and Google-owner Alphabet are yet to monetize the technology in which they have been pumping billions of dollars in the hope that it will have a big impact across industries.OpenAI, which is backed by Microsoft, said its latest GPT-4 AI model can reduce the process of content moderation to a few hours from months and ensure more consistent labeling.Content moderation can be a grueling task for social media firms such as Facebook-parent Meta, which works with thousands of moderators around the world to block users from seeing harmful content such as child pornography and images of extreme violence."The process (of content moderation) is inherently slow and can lead to mental stress on human moderators," OpenAI said. "With this system, the process of developing and customizing content policies is trimmed down from months to hours."Separately, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said on Tuesday that the startup does not train its AI models on user-generated data.(Reporting by Jaspreet Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva)

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan is making a bigger bet on bonds and credit and is adding leverage to pay for it.The pension fund, one of Canada’s largest institutional investors, earned a 1.9% investment return in the first half as its fixed income and credit portfolio advanced and stocks rebounded from last year’s correction.Bond holdings jumped to C$118 billion ($87.5 billion) at the end of June, 55% higher than at the end of December, the Toronto-based fund said in a statement Tuesday.Bond yields are much higher now than after the Covid shock, Chief Investment Officer Ziad Hindo said in an interview, making them a more appealing bet if the economy gets worse. The pension fund added exposure to longer-dated bonds and to the front end of the curve, where yields are “quite high” due to central banks’ tighter policy.“When you’re buying bonds when yields are at circa 4%, they become more income-producing, which is attractive,” Hindo said. “The starting level of yields means that they have a better chance at diversifying the portfolio when equities sell off, when we have an economic slowdown — whereas when yields were low at zero or even negative, it was very hard to get any income or get any diversification benefit.”Ontario Teachers’ also increased its allocation to private credit. The firm remains interested in the leveraged loan market, where it’s finding opportunities to step into the place of traditional lenders.“We’re seeing institutions like ourselves come into the credit market at a time where perhaps there’s a bit of retrenchment in lending, particularly from banks,” Hindo said.Story continuesOntario Teachers’, like a number of other Canadian pension funds, takes advantage of strong credit ratings to borrow in short- and long-term funding markets to fuel investments and to participate in derivatives markets. The fund’s leverage soared during the first half, with funding for investments rising 47%, to C$145 billion. In this case, the increase was due to derivatives used to boost the fund’s overall exposure to fixed income, spokesperson Dan Madge said by email.Read More: Ontario Teachers’ in Talks With Banks About Buying More LoansOntario Teachers’ manages approximately 80% of of its nearly C$250 billion portfolio with in-house employees, focusing on active strategies. It doesn’t break down returns by asset class in its mid-year results, and it didn’t give a benchmark return for comparison Tuesday.The pension fund said in June that it’s working on an overhaul of its real estate operations and is seeking a global head to lead it. The search includes internal and external candidates, Chief Executive Officer Jo Taylor said. “The real change of emphasis was around our international real estate investing activities, which is one of the areas we’ve been trying to build some diversification away from Canadian real estate,” Taylor said.Ontario Teachers’ also added to its private equity bets in the first half, buying a co-control position in US data-center company Compass Datacenters LLC alongside Brookfield Infrastructure Partners.“Some of the private markets for us are a little quieter than they may have been through 2022,” Taylor said. “And that’s just basically the level of activity, there’s an element of people waiting to see how valuations adjust and which assets are available for transactions.”(Adds spokesperson’s comment in 8th paragraph)©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: By Joey RouletteWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. space startups have slashed workforces and restructured operations to survive amid an investment drought that has grounded once-lofty aspirations.While more established players like Elon Musk's SpaceX and Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin spend billions on new, bigger rockets, rocket startup Astra Space, satellite imagery firm Planet Labs and privately held engine maker Ursa Major recently laid off workers to cut costs.Those struggles follow the April bankruptcy filing by satellite launch firm Virgin Orbit, which was owned by billionaire Richard Branson. Among the factors cited by the company were volatile capital markets and Branson's reluctance to invest further."The focus for investors in this space is very different than what it was a couple years ago. It's less about your potential," Ursa Major CEO Joe Laurienti told Reuters. "It's more about how can you build a healthy pipeline ... and execute and deliver upon the efforts that you promised."While a steep drop in space investments spurred by a grim economic outlook in the past year appeared to stabilize in the most recent quarter, startups, many of which went public through blank-check companies to raise cash, are reeling from the downturn's impact.Quilty Analytics analyst Caleb Henry called it a tough capital market and said startups are working with what they have rather than banking on an influx of new funds."We're seeing a bit of a decrease in investor risk appetite, and that is made worse in some cases by poor company performance, and then more broadly, things like high interest rates and general market uncertainty," he added.Astra disclosed last week it laid off a quarter of its workforce and diverted focus from its rocket launch program, once the core of its business. It is now focusing on its satellite propulsion unit, a more immediate source of revenue that it split off as a separate entity earlier this year.Story continues"The spacecraft engine business is a much different business than launch," Astra CEO Chris Kemp told Reuters. "Having it all mixed up with launch was making it harder for us to raise capital"The company, which is delaying tests of its rocket to 2024 to focus on the satellite engine unit, reported on Monday it had $26 million in cash and securities on hand. That was down from $201 million the prior year.STEEP CHALLENGESWith complex technologies and explosion-riddled tests that often spook investors, venture-backed and publicly traded rocket businesses have faced some of the steepest financial challenges. The industry also includes satellite imagery and analytics firms, seen as safer bets by investors due to more predictable demand.But even those satellite firms have struggled.Planet Labs, which went public in 2021, shed 10% of its roughly 1,000 employees earlier this month, citing the tough economy and the company's overly fast expansion."Our business has scaled rapidly and continues to grow apace, but the expansion of projects has also increased cost and complexity, which slowed us down in some regards," CEO Will Marshall told employees in an Aug. 1 note posted on the company's website.Quilty's Henry said Planet Labs hired too aggressively. "That's not an uncommon mistake for startups to make, especially once they become flush with cash."The financial headwinds faced by rocket startups have triggered pain elsewhere as well.Denver-based Ursa Major, whose engines are designed for rockets and hypersonic crafts, laid off 27% of its workforce this summer. It shifted much of its focus to government defense programs as its commercial customers face tight capital markets, CEO Laurienti said."The hope is that shift really generated some confidence," he added, "and started to show that we're acknowledging this isn't times of zero percent interest rates and venture capital flowing like crazy."(Reporting by Joey Roulette in Washington; Editing by Ben Klayman and Matthew Lewis)

Text Content: Home Depot's (HD) second quarter earnings call gave investors an inside look at how the Federal Reserve's monetary policy is weighing on the retailer's outlook.When asked whether the industry had seen a bottom in sales declines, Home Depot CEO Ted Decker offered caution on the rest of the year."Fears of a recession, or at least a severe recession, have largely subsided, and the consumer is generally healthy," Decker told investors on the call. "But given all those positives, ... uncertainties remain.""We don't know how quickly or further the share shift [from goods to services] in PCE will occur and where spending in home improvement, in particular, will ultimately settle," Decker added. "And we don't know how the monetary policy actions, which are specifically intended to dampen consumer demand, what that impact will ultimately have on consumer sentiment in the overall economy."The company reiterated its guidance for full-year sales to drop between 2% to 5% compared to fiscal 2022 and diluted earnings per share are expected to drop between 7% and 13% compared to last year.Home Depot self-serve checkout lines in Miami, Florida. (Jeffrey Greenberg/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)The guidance comes as the Federal Reserve has raised its policy rate to a range of 5.25%-5.50%, the highest level since March 2001, in an effort to bring down inflation. Fed officials have left the door open to another increase this year, which could further hit consumers via borrowing costs and the housing market.This led to a direct impact on the retail giant, where consumers spent less on big-ticket items last quarter."Big-ticket comp transactions or those over $1,000 were down 5.5% compared to the second quarter of last year," Billy Bastek, an executive vice president, said on the call. "After three years of unprecedented demand in the home improvement market, we continue to see softer engagement in big-ticket discretionary categories like patio and appliances that likely reflects both pull-forward of these single item purchases and deferrals."Story continuesConsumer 'incredibly resilient'There were positives in the quarter."If you look at our operations, what we can specifically control, we feel great about where we are halfway through this year," Decker said on the call.He outlined other bright spots in the economy too: "While that shift [in consumer spending] is happening, the overall economy and the consumer in particular have remained incredibly resilient. As we all know, the economy continues to grow with a number — another great GDP print for the second quarter."Retail sales out Tuesday backed up that sentiment as well, rising 0.7% in July from the previous month, in a positive surprise for Wall Street.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Home equity is also up in the last couple of years, which is good news for Home Depot."If you look at the home improvement customer — our core customer, the homeowner — they've seen continued growth in home equity over the last several years, strong job growth, and increases in wages," Decker said. "So the core customer remains strong."Per CoreLogic, the average US homeowner now owns more than $274,000 in equity, up from $182,000 pre-pandemic. And in July, job growth slowed but held steady while wages rose more than expected, rising 0.4% on a monthly basis and 4.4% over last year.Lastly, Decker touted Home Depot's "meaningful reduction in inventory." In the second quarter, merchandise inventories stood at $23.3 billion, down $2.8 billion compared to Q2 of 2022.Now as the company looks to the second half of the year, it's hoping seasonal items offer a clearer picture of consumer sentiment and a boost to sales."The nearest-term view of consumer is the engagement in seasonal is led by the consumer," Decker said. "Certainly, the garden business but also things like exterior painting and stain. ... When the weather improved, consumer responded and it was really steady constructive demand."Halloween decorations sit on the sales floor in a Home Depot store on October 13, 2021, in Miami, Florida. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)With Halloween around the corner, Home Depot expects to benefit there too."It's not an enormous business for us," Decker said about the holiday. "But to [see] unbelievable engagement ... in that product category, which is 100% discretionary, is a pretty decent telltale of engagement in the sector."—Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Text Content: (Adds UAW president comment in paragraph 3, previous comments by the Detroit Three in paragraph 5, background on the talks in paragraphs 6-11)Aug 15 (Reuters) - United Auto Workers members are planning to vote next week to authorize possible strikes at the Detroit Three automakers ahead of a Sept. 14 deadline, the union said on Tuesday.The UAW's warning comes as the union and General Motors , Ford Motor and Stellantis have made little headway with their negotiations, according to UAW President Shawn Fain, who will host a public meeting on Facebook at 6 p.m. ET (2200 GMT) on Tuesday."Whether or not there's a strike next month is entirely up to the Big Three automakers," Fain said in a statement. "Our priorities are clear, the companies can afford them, and there's plenty of time for the Big Three to get serious about these negotiations."The UAW said the talks with all three companies have yet to progress beyond non-economic issues.The three automakers have said they want to reach a deal that is fair to the workers but also gives the companies flexibility at a time when the industry is shifting from gasoline-powered vehicles to electric ones.U.S. President Joe Biden on Monday called on the automakers and the UAW to reach "a fair agreement" before the contracts expire. The union represents 150,000 workers at the three companies.The announcement comes as labor unions are taking advantage of low unemployment to push for higher pay and better working conditions during talks for new labor agreements.The UAW has repeatedly pointed out how the three automakers have reported a combined $250 billion in profits from 2013 to 2022 and argued the hourly workers deserve to benefit as well.The union is seeking raises of 40% over a four-year contract, cost-of-living adjustments, elimination of a tiered wage system, and including workers at joint-venture battery plants in its contracts.Several analysts on Wall Street have said the chances for a strike are greater than 50%. Deutsche Bank previously estimated that a strike would hit earnings at each affected automaker by about $400 million to $500 million per week of production.The UAW said Tuesday that it recently raised strike pay to $500 per week per member and has over $825 million in its strike fund.

Text Content: By Jonathan StempelNEW YORK (Reuters) - New York state on Tuesday fined Avis Budget Group $275,000 for refusing to rent vehicles to customers who did not have credit cards.Letitia James, the state's attorney general, said the civil fine resolved charges that the operator of Avis Car Rental, Budget Rent a Car and Payless Car Rental violated a state law against requiring credit cards for vehicle rentals.A probe begun late last year following a customer complaint found that 74 out of 106 Avis and Budget locations across New York insisted on credit cards, while 32 accepted debit cards.Investigators also called dozens of locations and Avis Budget's national call center, and were told repeatedly that a "major credit card" was required."This practice unfairly harms low-income consumers and communities of color who are less likely to own a credit card, and no one should be discriminated against because of their credit or banking status," James said in a statement.According to an assurance of discontinuance, Avis Budget did not contest the claim it violated state law, and indicated it had been unaware that some locations did not accept debit cards.The Parsippany, New Jersey-based company also agreed to improve employee training and provide compliance reports.An outside public relations firm for Avis Budget did not immediately respond to requests for comment.(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Mark Potter)

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- The largest exchange-traded fund focused on high-flying stocks has been losing its edge.The $9 billion iShares MSCI USA Momentum Factor ETF (ticker MTUM) is trailing the S&P 500 by the most ever on an annual basis, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The fund, which seeks exposure to shares exhibiting higher-price trends and at its height commanded more than $18 billion in assets, hasn’t seen a full week of inflows since January. After a $2.9 billion exodus, it’s on pace for the worst year of outflows since its 2013 inception.While MTUM has a sizable portion in tech stocks, it only added Nvidia Corp. in May, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That means the fund has missed out on a lot of the artificial-intelligence rally this year. The ETF is also heavily skewed toward one of 2023’s worst-performing sectors: health care. Meantime, its exposure to energy — a sector that’s rising again — has been cut to 5% from 25% at the start of the year.It’s the latest case of a capricious stock market delivering a crushing blow to momentum-chasing investors — with ill-timed rebalancing schedules at a time when former losers like megacaps rebound.“This is the tricky portion with factor ETFs — timing when one works and when another falls out of favor is very challenging,” said Todd Sohn, ETF strategist at Strategas. “With MTUM, their semi-annual balance methodology has missed the bulk of most sector moves, particularly in what feels like an equity market that sees major moves occur within shorter and shorter time frames.”MTUM usually rebalances in May and November. Nvidia is its top holding, followed by companies including Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp., Eli Lilly & Co. and Exxon Mobil Corp., data compiled by Bloomberg show.Story continuesTech stocks have ripped higher this year, buoyed partly by optimism over the promises of AI. Nvidia, which has more than tripled in the span, had already clocked a big portion of that gain before being added to MTUM.Factor investing selects companies not by industry, but by specific traits like how fast their prices are moving. MTUM has lost 0.5% this year, compared with a 16% advance in the S&P 500.The momentum factor has made little progress over the past year, and certain trends don’t bode well for future returns, according to Christopher Cain, quantitative equity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence.Cain looked at the Russell 1000. The dispersion of individual stock returns within the index is elevated, and a large range of returns suggest internal market rotation. That could “adversely affect momentum strategies” because the factor — at its core — relies on the premise that current trends will be extended, Cain noted.A similar situation happened a few years ago. Stock dispersion was elevated in 2016, and the long/short momentum factor struggled during that stretch, Cain wrote in a note. When it settled down the following year, the momentum factor rose.Sylvia Jablonski, co-founder and chief investment officer at Defiance ETFs, says that MTUM’s semi-annual rebalances worked out great in the years before the pandemic. But post-Covid, more frequent rebalances may have led to better returns given uncertainty of recession and a very reactive market.“The thesis of ‘what goes high will continue to go higher’ does often work out to some degree — but when you get a pullback, decay tends to be unfavorable for this factor,” she said. “That being said, if we have a nice stock rally post August into year-end, this ETF just may regather the wind in its sails.”--With assistance from Athanasios Psarofagis.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: (Adds details, further quotes)By Alexandra ValenciaQUITO, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Ecuadorean presidential candidate Luisa Gonzalez, who has led polls ahead of a Sunday vote riven by the murder of one of her competitors, said on Tuesday she will use $2.5 billion from international reserves to shore up the struggling economy if elected.Anti-corruption candidate Fernando Villavicencio, a long-time antagonist of Gonzalez's mentor, former President Rafael Correa, was gunned down leaving an event in Quito last week, highlighting deteriorating security in the Andean country and prompting his erstwhile competitors to pledge to fight crime.Ecuador has leaned on international financing since its economy was battered by the coronavirus pandemic.The country concluded acredit agreementfor$6.5 billionwith the International Monetary Fund at the end of last year and this month took out a$500 millionloan with the Inter-American Development Bank.Alack of employmenthas motivated many young people to emigrate, even via dangerous routes, in search of opportunities.Ecuador had some $6.96 billion in international reserves as of June, according to central bank data."I'll bring $2.5 billion to inject into the national economy, money that isn't generating anything, which is stored and not generating a cent, to guarantee the payments to bondholders," Gonzalez, 45, told Reuters in an interview.Some $500 million would go toward police arms and vehicles, she said, with equal amounts for health and education, small business loans and infrastructure.An expansion of debt with organization like the IMF would need to be well thought out, Gonzalez said."I know how to invest it," she said. "We won't pay a debt to die, so we are left in unemployment, so we are left without medicines.""The debts that we have, the bond payments are planned. The debt must of course be honored and for the rest we'll look according to expiry dates."Story continuesA lawyer and former lawmaker, Gonzalez has led polling with about 30% of voting intention. No polls have been published since Villavicencio's murder.Gonzalez has pledged to bring back social policies reminiscent of Correa's decade in power.The former president left office in 2017 and was later sentenced to eight years in prison on corruption charges. Correa has lived in Belgium since he left office and Gonzalez has denied she would pardon him if elected."We are going to reactivate the economy with public investment in infrastructure. Efficient public investment attracts foreign investment, activates the economy and pushes the private sector to create dignified employment," she said.Improvements to security cannot just be focused on security forces, she added, but must take into account social factors."When poverty rises, unemployment rises, violence rises," she said.Ecuador and neighboring Colombia must work together to control their border, a cocaine trafficking hub, Gonzalez added.Correa would serve as one of her advisors, she said, and she has already asked him to meet with Colombian President Gustavo Petro."We are advancing in conversations for joint work," she said, adding she has asked European Union ambassadors in Ecuador for help with technology and intelligence to fight crime.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- JBS SA, the world’s largest meat supplier, expects profits at its largest unit to remain tight as cattle availability in the US is seen shrinking further through next year.Profit margins at JBS’s North American beef operation will remain at “low single-digit” levels, with ranchers expected to withhold females as part of the efforts to replenish the herd, Wesley Batista Filho, the unit’s head, said Tuesday in an earnings call with analysts.The Sao Paulo-based company on Monday reported quarterly earnings that missed some analysts estimates.Read More: World’s Top Meat Supplier Posts Second-Straight Quarterly LossShrinking cattle herds in the US and higher prices of the grain used as feed have made it more costly to produce meat. Meanwhile, producers are also struggling with an abundance of chicken and pork as consumer demand retreats from levels seen during the pandemic.Still, JBS’s pork and chicken businesses are poised to recover more quickly than beef, with early signs of a much-needed supply slowdown and a recent drop in feed costs. The brighter outlook was echoed by Miguel Gularte, CEO of rival BRF SA, who on Monday said the worst of the chicken supply glut is “being overcome”.It’s not all bad for beef — increasing availability of cattle for slaughter in Brazil and Australia should boost beef margins in both countries, JBS said.JBS shares rose 2.3% as of 11:12 a.m. in Sao Paulo.--With assistance from Dayanne Sousa.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Blackstone Inc.’s $68 billion real estate trust said its president A.J. Agarwal will go on a sabbatical for nine months and Rob Harper will fill that role.Agarwal will be on a continuing education sabbatical starting Sept. 15 and will serve as an observer of the board throughout that time, according to a filing Tuesday from Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust. Harper, who joined the private equity firm in 2002, is currently BREIT’s head of asset management.Blackstone built BREIT into a massive player in the real estate industry, but the trust’s growth streak has come under pressure in recent months as investors sought to pull money when rising interest rates prompted a global flight for cash. BREIT has limited withdrawals for nine consecutive months to avoid forced sales, but the redemption queue has been easing recently.Agarwal will be pursuing a sabbatical at a Stanford University program. He stepped down from his role as president effective August 14.“Blackstone has a deep bench of talent and we are fortunate to have Rob, who has been invaluable to BREIT and instrumental to its success since inception,” Frank Cohen, chief executive officer of BREIT, said in the filing. “We look forward to A.J.’s return but we know he will enjoy his academic year at Stanford after 31 years at Blackstone.”A major share class for BREIT has posted a net return of 2.6% this year through the end of July, compared with an 8.4% gain in all of 2022 and a 30% increase in 2021.Commercial real estate markets have been hit by the sudden rise in borrowing costs as well as shifting demand for properties such as offices. A measure of prices has fallen 12% over the past year through July, according to real estate analytics firm Green Street.Story continuesBREIT has sought to focus on properties such as student housing, industrial warehouses and data centers, which lifted BREIT’s returns in July. The trust has “virtually no” exposure to commodity offices, BREIT has said.Blackstone has held years-long discussions to shift leadership atop the real estate business that houses BREIT. In February, Wesley LePatner stepped up to run the “Core+” property business business when Cohen ceded leadership. Cohen retained his role as chairman and CEO of BREIT and remains global chairman of Core+.(Updates with details on commercial property market starting in seventh paragraph.)©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: The 2023 debt-ceiling standoff is over. The consequences are not.It may seem like every debt-ceiling showdown follows a standard script, with everything going back to normal once the foolish drama is over.The basic plot: With the nation’s borrowing limit set by law and federal borrowing going ever higher, Congress has to raise the limit every couple of years. Republicans, if they have the votes, insist on spending cuts as a condition of allowing the government to borrow more. There’s intense bargaining and overheated talk of a possible US default on some of its obligations. That briefly unnerves financial markets.Then, a last-second deal materializes, averting disaster, and markets settle down.The 2023 debt saga followed the usual playbook, except for one thing: everything has not returned to normal. Instead, markets now deem US Treasury securities more risky than before the June deal to raise the borrowing limit. That increases the cost of borrowing to the government, and to businesses and individuals, as well.During the next 10 years, higher interest rates due solely to Congressional budget shenanigans could raise borrowing costs in the United States by nearly $1 trillion, according to new research by David Kotok, chief investment officer of investing firm Cumberland Advisors. While that's a large price tag, the costs are likely to be spread broadly across the economy in ways likely to allow the perpetrators in Congress to escape accountability.Kotok looks at the cost of credit-default swaps on US Treasuries to assess higher borrowing costs throughout the US economy. A credit-default swap, or CDS, is like an insurance policy on a bond. The holder of a bond sometimes wants to cover the risk that the issuer will default and fail to pay the interest or principal. Other investors offer CDSs that will cover losses at prices the market determines.Debt deal a bad deal? U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) ahead of Wednesday's vote in the U.S. House of Representatives on a bill raising the federal government's $31.4 trillion debt ceiling last May. (REUTERS/Julia Nikhinson)As expected, the cost of insuring against a US default rose as Congress played chicken with the nation's creditworthiness earlier this year. The US government hit its borrowing limit in January 2023, which forced the Treasury Dept. to move money around to meet all the government’s obligations. Treasury estimated it would be able to do that until June, when it would have to default on some payments.Story continuesBefore Treasury hit the borrowing limit in January, the cost of insuring a 10-year Treasury bond was about 35 basis points, according to Bloomberg data. That’s equivalent to .35% of the face value of the bond per year, paid like an insurance premium.The cost of that insurance went as high as 62 basis points as the June deadline drew near. Once Congress struck a deal to suspend the debt ceiling until 2025, the price of a CDS dropped, as expected. But it didn’t drop back to pre-crisis levels. Instead, it settled at around 41 basis points. Then it rose to around 48 basis points after rating agency Fitch downgraded US debt by one notch on August 1.The interest rate on Treasury bonds rises by roughly the same amount as the price of insuring against their default. So US interest rates are roughly 10 basis points higher now than they’d be if Congress had simply raised the borrowing limit smoothly, without any risk of default.One-tenth of a percentage point may not sound like much, but applied to the whole range of federal and private debt in the United States, it adds up.Raising the rate the US must pay to borrow by a single basis point adds $2.7 billion a year to federal borrowing costs, Kotok estimates. Multiplying by 10 brings the annual total to $27 billion in additional borrowing costs. Projecting that out for a decade brings the total to $270 billion, but compounding could make it more like $300 billion.Taxpayers are on the hook for that $300 billion. Republicans who control the House of Representatives and demanded spending cuts as a condition of raising the borrowing limit claim the budget deal will reduce deficits by $1.3 trillion during the next decade, including $240 billion in lower interest payments on US debt. But that doesn’t include the possible $300 billion in higher borrowing costs given that the market now perceives US debt as riskier. So the higher risk of default is zeroing out that savings.[Drop Rick Newman a note, follow him on Twitter, or sign up for his newsletter.]The Republican projections are also unusually rosy.The Penn Wharton Budget Model estimates that the GOP’s forecast of $1.3 trillion in savings is at the high end of possible outcomes, with the low end being $234 billion—not including $300 billion in higher borrowing costs. Under that scenario, the whole budget deal would produce no savings at all and actually cost taxpayer nearly $70 billion.Congress struck a debt ceiling deal last spring. But there have been consequences. (REUTERS/Nathan Howard)The 10-year Treasury bond is the benchmark for mortgage rates and many other consumer and business loans, which rise and fall in proportion to the 10-year. So a 10-basis point hike in the 10-year will produce a similar rise in most other rates. In addition to $27 trillion in federal US debt, there’s also about $43 trillion in business, individual and state and local debt. Kotok estimates a 10-basis point rise in borrowing costs across all that debt will cost about $1 trillion during the next decade.Most people won’t notice, so they won’t barnstorm Congress demanding better budget stewardship. The CDS market is complex and obscure, and even some professional investors won't account for this gradually rising risk of a US default. But they’ll pay, anyway.Congressional recklessness on the borrowing limit is far from over. The suspension of the debt ceiling until January 2025 means another self-destructive budget fight is likely then. When Fitch downgraded the US credit rating on August 1, it cited “expected fiscal deterioration over the next three years,” the “erosion of governance” and “repeated debt limit standoffs and last-minute resolutions.” If there was some way of knowing the 2023 standoff was the last one, Fitch might not have downgraded.But there’s every reason to think another game of chicken is coming.Rick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

Text Content: (Adds Citgo declined to comment in paragraph 7)By Marianna Parraga and Vivian SequeraHOUSTON/CARACAS, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Negotiators and officials representing Venezuela are opposing a court-ordered auction of shares in a parent of oil refiner Citgo Petroleum to pay creditors claiming more than $10 billion from expropriations and debt defaults.Some 20 creditors with arbitration awards or lawsuits against Venezuela and its state oil company PDVSA on Monday asked a federal court in Delaware to register their cases so they can participate in the October-scheduled auction. The auction puts priority on when claims were filed.Including interest and fees, the collective claims of companies including Crystallex International, ConocoPhillips , Tenaris SA and Exxon Mobil could exceed the market value of Citgo, the Venezuela-owned U.S. refiner, which has recently been put at between $10 billion and $13 billion.The boards that supervise Citgo since the company severed ties with its ultimate parent, Caracas-headquartered PDVSA, have unsuccessfully sought to negotiate payments with some of the larger creditors since last year."This is pointless, it is an unmanageable process," Horacio Medina, the head of the board that supervises Citgo, said of the court's decision to open the auction to all claimants. "What is the point ... To show that Venezuela owes $150 billion and cannot pay everyone? Why then to auction off an asset that would make it possible to negotiate additional payments?"The team representing Venezuela in the Delaware proceedings has been "very limited" in its effort negotiate payments, especially since the U.S. Treasury Department in March approved the court-organized auction.Spokespeople for Citgo, the U.S. Departments of Treasury and Justice declined to comment.U.S. Senator Bob Menendez has said he will introduce a bill that would add Venezuela to the jurisdiction of the Department of Justice's Foreign Claims Settlement Commission. The move would ensure "an orderly process of adjudication for legal claims of U.S. nationals against the Venezuelan government," according to his office.Story continuesThat process could provide a fairer way to resolve the creditors' claims. But it could arrive too late for stopping the auction in Delaware, Medina said.Menendez's office did not immediately reply to a request for comment.Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, who has repeatedly criticized the upcoming auction, on Monday rejected the way Citgo is being managed, adding the company "has been kidnapped by the United States.""They are simply stealing a company that is worth $12 billion and that belongs to Venezuelans," he said late on Monday in a broadcast event.Venezuela's National Assembly in May formally rejected the U.S. Treasury's approval of the auction.(Reporting by Marianna Parraga in Houston and Vivian Sequera in Caracas; Editing by Gary McWilliams and Matthew Lewis)

Text Content: By Gwladys FoucheOSLO (Reuters) - Norway's $1.4 trillion wealth fund, the world's single largest stock market investor, is urging firms it invests in to engage with artificial intelligence as a way to drive profits, but to do so responsibly, top officials told Reuters.Fund CEO Nicolai Tangen said it was crucial for all firms in its portfolio to engage with AI, as it is "potentially a massive driver for productivity and efficiency" that is becoming an everyday business tool like power, computers or the internet."We of course expect them to use AI for the best possible benefit of the business," Tangen said in an interview. "AI is a huge opportunity for companies and for society, but we need to make sure that it is used in the right way."Tangen said a company that would not engage with AI "would disqualify themselves as being complete morons".The fund invests in 9,200 firms worldwide, for which it sets expectations on a range of issues, from children's rights to climate change.Its latest document, to be published Wednesday, is on consumers' interests, with a heavy focus on AI.When talking to firms about responsible AI, the fund will concentrate particularly on the healthcare, finance and large tech sectors, because their use of the technology will have an especially strong impact on consumers.Companies must be able to explain why they are developing particular AI systems and how they have been designed, trained and tested, according to the document. There should also be effective human oversight and control.That is so "people (who) are affected by the outcomes can actually go back to the company and ask 'how does your algorithm work? Why did I not get the loan?'", said Carine Smith Ihenacho, the fund's chief governance and compliance officer.Among other expectations set in the document, the fund said companies must be proactive in their management of AI-related risks, and have systems in place if or when things go wrong.Story continuesSpecial responsibility lies with the top tech companies that develop AI technology since they are driving the change, said the fund, a top ten investor in Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet and Nvidia."They have to take responsibility for their development and use of AI," said Smith Ihenacho, adding the fund had already discussed AI with the large U.S. tech companies in its portfolio."We have done it and we will continue to do it," she said.She welcomed recent self-regulation moves by U.S. tech giants as "a good start", but noted that there were "no proper regulations in place yet" and that more was needed.In July, U.S. AI companies made voluntary commitments to the White House to implement measures such as watermarking AI-generated content to make the technology safer."That is where there is room for investors like us to come in and fill the gap," said Smith Ihenacho.Tech is the largest sector in the fund's equity investments, representing 11.9% of the its total value at end-2022, its data showed.Dialogue with companies and voting at annual general meetings is the focus of its environment, social and governance (ESG) approach, but the fund can, and does, divest from companies that do not comply with its requirements. Last year it divested from 74 firms on those grounds.(Reporting by Gwladys Fouche; Editing by Terje Solsvik and Jan Harvey)

Text Content: By Nate Raymond(Reuters) - A judicial reform advocacy group on Tuesday filed a complaint accusing a Texas federal judge of engaging in misconduct by taking the "strange" step of requiring three attorneys for Southwest Airlines to attend "religious liberty training" by a prominent conservative Christian legal group.The head of the group Fix the Court in a judicial misconduct complaint filed with the 5th Circuit Judicial Council accused U.S. District Judge Brantley Starr in Dallas of violating the judicial code of conduct by assigning a sectarian organization to carry out the attorney sanctions he ordered in a religious bias case brought by a flight attendant against the airline.That organization, Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), is a well-known conservative legal group previously not involved in the case that advocates for religious liberty and has brought cases challenging LGBTQ rights and the ability of women to secure abortions.Jim Campbell, ADF's chief legal counsel, in a statement called it "baseless and intolerant to suggest that people of faith cannot provide legal instruction simply because their religious beliefs might differ from their audience's."Starr, a former assistant Texas attorney general, was appointed to the bench in 2019 by former Republican President Donald Trump.He is the nephew of Kenneth Starr, who spearheaded the investigation that led to the impeachment of former Democratic President Bill Clinton in 1998 and was a member of ADF's Supreme Court Advisory Council before his death in September 2022.Starr did not respond to requests for comment.Southwest, which declined comment, is appealing Starr's order, which tasked ADF with training its lawyers after he determined they undermined an earlier decision he made in the case.Starr said that instead of notifying employees of their rights against religious discrimination, as he had ordered Southwest to do, the lawyers penned a memo warning workers not to violate company civility policies that led it to terminate flight attendant Charlene Carter.Story continuesShe had alleged she was fired for criticizing her union's decision to participate in the 2017 Women's March, a nationwide protest following Trump's inauguration, because Planned Parenthood was a sponsor. Carter says she is a Christian who opposes abortion. Southwest denied the allegations.ADF has led efforts to restrict the availability of the abortion pill mifepristone and helped draft a Mississippi law at the center of the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling last year overturning the national right to abortion.In Tuesday's complaint, Gabe Roth, the executive director of Fix the Court, said that while training can at times be a fair sanction to impose on a lawyer, Starr's order "sets a dangerous precedent."He said such a religious-based sanction was "unprecedented" and inconsistent with Canon 3 of the Code of Conduct for U.S. Judges, which holds that "a judge should perform the duties of the office fairly, impartially and diligently."Starr in imposing the sanction had cited past cases where lawyers were ordered to attend ethics training.But Roth argued that unlike legal ethics, which have generally agreed upon precepts for training curriculums, religious liberty means different things under different faiths. No sectarian organization of any faith should be allowed to carry out such a court-ordered sanction as a result, he said.Judicial misconduct complaints are subject to dismissal if they directly relate to the merits of a decision.Roth said should the circuit's chief judge determine his complaint should be dismissed under that rule, he requested a "limited inquiry" at least be undertaken to determine if ADF and Starr communicated privately beforehand.(Reporting by Nate Raymond in Boston, Editing by Alexia Garamfalvi and Marguerita Choy)

Text Content: (Adds Treasury Dept. comment)By Andrea ShalalLAS VEGAS, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Daemein Hargrove, 21, recently dropped plans for a four-year college degree to sign up for an apprenticeship program in Las Vegas that he says has given him higher pay, good medical benefits and a pension.It was made possible by a surge in solar investment fueled by U.S. President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, which helped spark some $110 billion in new clean energy projects since it passed a year ago.Hargrove says the job and his membership in the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers union have enabled him and his wife to move into an apartment. They're now starting to think seriously about buying a home and starting a family."There have been a lot of good things over the last couple of months, at least for me," Hargrove told Reuters. But he's also shouldering gas costs of $500 a month as he commutes to a massive solar site 45 minutes outside of Las Vegas.He's not sure he'll vote in 2024, when Biden is up for re-election, he said."To me, it just feels like it's out of my control," he said, speaking about U.S. politics in general.As the 2024 election season draws closer, Biden and his team are traveling the United States to talk about the recession-defying economy, and the impact of the president's clean energy tax breaks, union support and infrastructure investment.

Text Content: By Andrea ShalalLAS VEGAS, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Daemein Hargrove, 21, recently dropped plans for a four-year college degree to sign up for an apprenticeship program in Las Vegas that he says has given him higher pay, good medical benefits and a pension.It was made possible by a surge in solar investment fueled by President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, which helped spark some $110 billion in new clean energy projects since it passed a year ago.Hargrove says the job, and his membership in the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers union have enabled him and his wife to move into an apartment. They're now starting to think seriously about buying a home and starting a family. "There have been a lot of good things over the last couple of months, at least for me," Hargrove told Reuters. But he's also shouldering gas costs of $500 a month as he commutes to a massive solar site 45 minutes outside of Las Vegas.He's not sure he'll vote in 2024, when Biden is up for re-election, he said."To me, it just feels like it's out of my control," he said, speaking about U.S. politics in general.As the 2024 election season draws closer, Biden and his team are travelling the U.S. to talk about the recession-defying economy, and the impact of the president's clean energy tax breaks, union support and infrastructure investment. They're studiously ignoring a growing list of indictments against former president and chief rival, Republican Donald Trump.Even as Americans like Hargrove feel the benefits, it's not clear this approach will deliver Biden the votes he needs in 2024.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Sacks Parente Golf Inc. shares skyrocketed 624% in its first day of trading, notching the best initial public offering debut on a US exchange this year.The company, which makes golf equipment including $400 putters, closed just shy of $29 Tuesday after pricing its initial public offering of 3.2 million shares at $4. The price of those clubs is only slightly less than the Scotty Cameron putter, a rival brand famously used by Tiger Woods throughout his career.Sacks Parente made just $190,000 in sales in 2022, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and it has yet to turn a profit. The Camarillo, California-based company had a net loss of $3.5 million last year. In the first three months of 2023, the company made $90,000 in net sales and had a net loss of $917,000.The gain came after a choppy day of trading for IPOs. Sacks Parente was halted at least 19 times for volatility during the session. SRM Entertainment Inc., which also made its trading debut Tuesday, was halted for volatility five times.--With assistance from Bailey Lipschultz.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Uruguay’s central bank delivered a bigger-than-expected interest rate cut after the inflation rate fell to an 18-year low in July, staying within its target range for a second consecutive month.Policymakers lowered their benchmark rate by 75 basis points to 10% on Tuesday, following a half-point cut last month. Most economists expected the bank to continue cutting rates by 50 basis points.“The monetary policy committee expects the reduction in year-on-year inflation will continue in the coming months” accompanied by a decline in inflation expectations, board members said in a statement that accompanied their decision. They added their monetary policy remains contractive.Future interest rate movements will depend on consumer price data and, to a greater degree, inflation expectations, they said.A growing number of Latin American countries including Brazil and Chile have started reducing borrowing costs as inflation cools down. Uruguay’s central bank was the first in South America to start easing monetary policy when it delivered a 25 basis-point cut in April.Consumer prices in July rose 4.79% from a year ago, down from 5.98% the previous month. The central bank said it sees inflation staying within its 3% to 6% target for the next 24 months.Policymakers expect growth will rebound in the third quarter after a drought affected the economy in the April-June period.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: (Adds fundraisers for families who lost loved ones)By Jorge Garcia and Mike BlakeKAHULUI, Hawaii, Aug 15 (Reuters) - A week after a ferocious wildfire ravaged the resort town of Lahaina on Hawaii's Maui island, anxious residents were still awaiting news of hundreds of missing loved ones on Tuesday, as teams with cadaver dogs conducted a painstaking block-by-block search of the ashes.Local, state and federal rescue workers have urged patience. The teams were proceeding as fast as possible, Maui County Police Chief John Pelletier said, but there was a "reverence" that encumbered the task of finding more of the dead, which already number at least 99 people - the most in any U.S. wildfire in more than a century."It's not just ash on your clothing when you take it off. It's our loved ones," Pelletier said at a Monday briefing.The search teams had covered only a quarter of the disaster area, he said, but he expressed hope that they could scan 85% to 90% by the weekend. Officials have encouraged survivors to provide DNA samples to assist in identifying remains, a challenge made more difficult by the fire's intense heat.The American Red Cross had received over 2,500 calls from people trying to find and reunite with relatives and friends missing from the fire, and about 800 of those have been resolved, said Chris Young, senior director for operations and readiness.Even as donations have poured in and Hawaii and federal officials have promised vast resources to aid in the recovery, some of the displaced have grown frustrated with the pace of the governmental response.Kanamu Balinbin, a local football coach, took matters into his own hands, setting up a relief camp where people who lost their homes and belongings could find water and food."I was devastated. I consider myself a strong leader, but it broke me," Balindin said about his emotions after witnessing the destruction. "This is what keeps me going, helping people. A lot of us are at that stage."Story continuesHe said some of the local frustration stemmed from the longstanding perception that Maui does not receive enough attention from the state government despite its robust tourism revenues.Only a handful of residents have been permitted back into Lahaina to visit their properties. Maui County had briefly relaxed restrictions but quickly suspended the visits on Monday after curiosity seekers clogged streets being used by rescue workers, officials said. One person was arrested for trespassing.Lani Moala was relieved to find her home was among the few left standing, thanks to a neighbor who doused houses with a water hose as people fled. But the rest of her neighborhood was devastated."Everything that way was just demolished. It's just so sad," Moala said on Monday, as she pointed down the road toward the ruins.Her extended family lost three of their five homes to the fires, including her grandmother's homestead on the edge of Lahaina. Moala said her family is finding strength and support in each other and in the close-knit Lahaina community."We're going to rebuild, and we're going to be Lahaina again," she said.Some residents, however, have already expressed concern that the 19th-century capital of the Kingdom of Hawaii - long known as a cultural and historic destination - could lose its character if outside investors are permitted to buy up distressed properties.Hawaii Governor Josh Green said he is already exploring legal options to prevent any immediate sales of properties that were damaged or destroyed."For my part, I will try to allow no one from out of state to buy any land until we go through this crisis to decide what Lahaina should be," he said on Monday.Nearly 2,000 housing units, including 400 hotel rooms, 1,400 Airbnb units and 160 private homes, were being made available for the displaced, Green said.UTILITY UNDER SCRUTINYOnly three of the deceased had been officially identified as of Monday, Pelletier said, but stories about those who perished have begun to emerge from friends and relatives.On the fundraising website GoFundMe, relatives of Kevin and Saane Tanaka said Saane's sister, 7-year-old nephew and parents were found in a burned-out car near their home on Thursday morning."Words cannot express how devastating this is for the family," the post said, noting that the Tanakas have had no time to grieve after taking in more than a dozen other displaced relatives.Another post described how Joe Schilling - "Uncle Joe" to his adopted family, the Bluhs - died while helping five elderly people escape from his housing complex."He was known as 'Funcle Joe' for a reason," Akiva Bluh wrote. "Whether it be the trips to go bullet-shell hunting or staying up late while my parents were gone so he could sneak us his famous sugar toast, he was always willing to act out of love and kindness towards myself and my brothers."Fueled by winds gusting up to 80 miles (128 km) per hour, the inferno reached temperatures of 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit (538 degrees Celsius) last Tuesday when it raced from the dry grasslands outside town into Lahaina.The deadly inferno destroyed or damaged more than 2,200 buildings, 86% of them residential, causing an estimated $5.5 billion in damage, authorities said.It remained unclear what ignited the fires, but utility Hawaiian Electric Industries has come under increasing scrutiny over whether its power equipment played any role in setting off the blazes.The utility, which is already facing proposed class action lawsuits, has seen its stock plunge in recent days. Company executives have defended its decision not to shut off power despite powerful winds that raised the risk of downed lines, saying that a shutdown could have cut off the water supply and hurt residents who rely on powered medical equipment.(Reporting by Jorge Garcia and Mike Blake in Maui; Additional reporting by Brendan O'Brien, Rich McKay, Andrew Hay, Brad Brooks, Sharon Bernstein and Dan Whitcomb; Writing by Joseph Ax and Brendan O'Brien; Editing by Frank McGurty, Jonathan Oatis and Sandra Maler)

Many have tragically lost their lives.”The case is the latest attempt to win compensation for miners and communities in southern Africa affected by the operations they worked at or lived near at times of laxer environmental standards. The papers were filed on behalf of 17 miners.Spoor has won compensation for asbestos miners who worked for now-defunct South African mining titan, Gencor Ltd., and gold miners who worked for companies including Anglo American Plc. Anglo is facing a separate suit over alleged lead poisoning near a mine in Zambia.South32, BHP and Seriti didn’t answer queries sent outside of normal working hours. South32 was spun off by BHP.

Text Content: (Updates prices, adds analyst comment in paragraphs 4 and 10) By Hannah Lang WASHINGTON, Aug 15 (Reuters) - The dollar index was flat after data showed U.S. retail sales increased more than expected in July, while the yuan sank to a nine-month trough on Tuesday after China's central bank unexpectedly cut key policy rates. U.S. retail sales jumped 0.7% last month, the Commerce Department said, demonstrating that demand has remained resilient despite the Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate hikes to tame inflation, thanks to strong wage gains from a tight labor market. The dollar index, which measures the currency against six peers including the euro and sterling, dropped as low as 102.800 after hitting a 1-1/2-month high at 103.46 on Monday. It was last up 0.058% at 103.200. "The dollar is holding relatively stable here, but we are seeing a lot of weakness in other currencies globally," said Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Corpay. The dollar gained over 0.5% against the offshore yuan to a nine-month high of 7.3307 as the People's Bank of China (PBOC) cut its rates in an effort to boost a sputtering economic recovery. Punctuating those worries, Chinese data on industrial output, retail sales and investment released shortly after the PBOC's rate cut showed unexpected slowdowns. "I think the strong U.S. sales data provided some relief to the negative surprise in the Chinese data, so this has pushed risk back up," said John Velis, head of Americas macro strategy at BNY Mellon Markets in New York. YEN WATCH Against the yen, the U.S. dollar pushed to a fresh nine-month high of 145.865, before dropping to a session low at 145.25. It was last trading at 145.66 per yen. Traders are looking for any hints of intervention, after the dollar's surge above 145 last autumn triggered the first yen buying by Japanese officials in a generation. "It does seem that authorities both at the People's Bank of China and at the Ministry of Finance in Japan are relatively comfortable with further depreciation in their currencies. However, they're certainly looking at and certainly prepared to step in if we see a disorderly one-sided move in currency markets," said Schamotta. Japanese Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki said on Tuesday that authorities are not targeting absolute currency levels when it comes to intervening in the market. Elsewhere, sterling rose after data showed British basic wages grew at a record pace, adding to the Bank of England's inflation worries. The pound was last 0.16% higher at $1.2705 following data showing British wages excluding bonuses were 7.8% higher than a year earlier in the three months to June. That represented the highest annual growth rate since comparable records began in 2001. The UK unemployment rate, however, unexpectedly rose to 4.2% from 4.0%, but money market traders still expect the Bank of England to raise rates by at least 25 basis points next month on worries high pay growth will lead to second-round effects on inflation. The euro was last unchanged $1.09045. The Russian rouble gave up early gains after Russia's central bank lifted its key interest rate by 350 basis points to 12% at an emergency meeting to try and halt the currency from weakening past 100 to the dollar after a public call from the Kremlin for tighter monetary policy. ======================================================== Currency bid prices at 3:00PM (1900 GMT) Description RIC Last U.S. Close Pct Change YTD Pct High Bid Low Bid Previous Change Session Dollar index 103.1900 103.1400 +0.06% -0.290% +103.2800 +102.8000 Euro/Dollar $1.0904 $1.0905 +0.00% +1.76% +$1.0952 +$1.0896 Dollar/Yen 145.6600 145.5650 +0.06% +11.09% +145.8600 +145.1050 Euro/Yen 158.84 158.71 +0.08% +13.21% +159.3300 +158.5500 Dollar/Swiss 0.8788 0.8783 +0.07% -4.95% +0.8796 +0.8745 Sterling/Dollar $1.2705 $1.2685 +0.16% +5.06% +$1.2752 +$1.2680 Dollar/Canadian 1.3492 1.3463 +0.22% -0.42% +1.3500 +1.3440 Aussie/Dollar $0.6463 $0.6488 -0.39% -5.19% +$0.6522 +$0.6456 Euro/Swiss 0.9582 0.9578 +0.04% -3.15% +0.9596 +0.9568 Euro/Sterling 0.8580 0.8594 -0.16% -2.99% +0.8609 +0.8574 NZ $0.5961 $0.5975 -0.23% -6.12% +$0.5996 +$0.5957 Dollar/Dollar Dollar/Norway 10.5200 10.4770 +0.33% +7.11% +10.5250 +10.4510 Euro/Norway 11.4689 11.4223 +0.41% +9.29% +11.4960 +11.4014 Dollar/Sweden 10.8584 10.7689 +0.65% +4.33% +10.8677 +10.7734 Euro/Sweden 11.8410 11.7648 +0.65% +6.20% +11.8670 +11.7565 (Reporting by Hannah Lang in Washington; additional reporting by Joice Alves and Samuel Indyk in London and Brigid Riley and Kevin Buckland; Editing by Susan Fenton, Jonathan Oatis and Chizu Nomiyama)

Text Content: (Reuters) - Canada's corporate ethics watchdog said on Tuesday it was investigating Ralph Lauren's Canada unit to probe allegations the apparel retailer's supply chain and operations in China used or benefited from the use of Uyghur forced labor.The Canadian Ombudsperson for Responsible Enterprise (CORE) said it had published an initial assessment report after complaints filed by a coalition of 28 civil society organizations in June 2022 against the Polo shirts maker.CORE said the report published detailed allegations the company had supply relationships with Chinese companies that use or benefit from the use of Uyghur forced labor.The watchdog said it was also looking into similar allegations for Canada-based mining and property investment firm GobiMin.Ralph Lauren and GobiMin did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.A similar investigation was launched by CORE into Nike Canada and Dynasty Gold in July over allegations they have or had supply chains or operations in China identified as using or benefiting from the use of Uyghur forced labor.In the last couple of years, several large U.S. and Canadian multinational companies have been accused of using Uyghur forced labor either directly or in their supply chains.CORE monitors and investigates human rights abuses mainly by Canadian garment, mining and oil and gas companies operating abroad.(Reporting by Granth Vanaik in Bengaluru; Editing by Krishna Chandra Eluri)

The chipmaker led the tech sector higher earlier in the year as it moved center stage amid an AI craze, thanks to its high-powered graphics cards and server products.Information Technology stocks have pulled back a bit in recent weeks amid concerns of an overbought market and rising bond yields.

Text Content: By David CarnevaliNEW YORK (Reuters) - Esmark Inc majority owner and chief executive James Bouchard said in an interview on Tuesday that his steel maker, which does not publicly report its earnings, has cash for its $7.8 billion bid for U.S. Steel Corp sitting in his bank account.Esmark unveiled its offer on Monday after Cleveland-Cliffs Inc, another steel maker, said on Sunday it had made a $7.3 billion offer for U.S. Steel, which the latter rejected. Cleveland-Cliffs said it could afford the deal because it would pay for half of it using its own stock as currency and borrow from banks to help pay for the other half.Bouchard said he had $10 billion available and Esmark itself had no debt. "I got $10 billion in cash in my bank account," Bouchard said. He did not provide more details to verify he has access to the cash.Bouchard added he was being advised on his offer for U.S. Steel by an "international bank" he declined to name, which was also willing to lend to him.U.S. Steel did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Bouchard, a former U.S. Steel executive, said Esmark was "the third largest steelmaker in the country", without elaborating with any figures. In 2008, he sold another company of his with the same name to Russian steelmaker OAO Severstal for $1.3 billion. He subsequently bought back the Esmark name, trademark and intellectual property to create his latest steel maker, which he says generates over $500 million in annual revenue.(Reporting by David Carnevali in New York; Editing by Josie Kao)

Text Content: (Rewrites throughout; adds quotes, context)SAO PAULO, Aug 15 (Reuters) -The recent increase in long-term interest rates in the U.S. demands that emerging markets to tread with caution, Brazil's central bank director Gabriel Galipolo said on Tuesday, after the bank delivered a larger-than-expected rate cut this month.Brazil kicked off itsmonetary easing cycleon Aug. 2 with a 50-basis-point reduction to 13.25%, its first in three years after a nearly year-long hold following 1,175 basis points of hikes to battle inflation.Speaking at an event hosted by COFECON, Galipolo backed the bank's decision to cut rates and said that despite the necessary caution, Brazil had some advantages over its emerging peers in the current backdrop."We are aware that scenarios of rising long-term interest rates in the U.S. require caution from emerging countries," Galipolo said.However, he added, Brazil is currently well-liked among foreign investors because of factors such as its high levels of foreign currency reserves and ability to play a leading role in the ecological transition.Galipolo was one of the first two central bank board members appointed by President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who has called on the monetary authority to lower interest rates since his inauguration in January.Despite the government pressure, Galipolo - who previously served as an economy ministry official - reiterated on Tuesday the central bank's decisions were "technical."He was one of the five board members who voted in favor of the 50-basis-point cut, while the other four voted for a more modest 25-basis-point cut.The monetary authority signaled more of the same in the months ahead due to an improving inflation outlook, but Galipolo avoided providing more clues on the central bank's stance, instead touting its official communique as "very accurate.""Speculation is normal," he said of future rate decisions. "But we have a lot of time until the next meeting and will keep monitoring expectations, inflation anchoring and the international scenario."Brazil's monetary policy committee, known as Copom, is scheduled to meet again on Sept. 19-20.

Text Content: *Canadian dollar weakens 0.2% against US dollar*Canada's annual inflation rate rises to 3.3%*Price of U.S. oil settles 1.8% lower*10-year yield touches its highest in nearly 15 yearsBy Fergal SmithTORONTO, Aug 15 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar weakened to a one-week low against its U.S. counterpart on Tuesday as investors grew more risk averse and despite hotter-than-expected domestic inflation data that supported bets for another Bank of Canada rate hike.The loonie was trading 0.2% lower at 1.3487 to the U.S. dollar, or 74.15 U.S. cents, after touching its weakest intraday level since last Tuesday at 1.35."There is a degree of correlation between the CAD and risk assets," said Bipan Rai, global head of FX strategy at CIBC Capital Markets. "It's more important to ask what's driving that and there's a confluence of factors."Wall Street's main indexes fell after stronger-than-expected U.S. retail sales data stoked worries interest rates could stay higher for longer, while the price of oil, one of Canada's major exports, was pressured by sluggish Chinese economic data. U.S. crude oil futures settled 1.8% lower at $80.99 a barrel.Canada's annual inflation rate rose more than expected to 3.3% in July, increasing the likelihood of another interest rate increase. Money markets see a 29% chance of a rate hike at the next policy decision on Sept. 6, up from 22% before the data."There is a certain degree of sticker shock with the (inflation) print overall but if you peel back the layers, you look at the core gauges, there is some evidence there that tighter (monetary) policy is starting to pass through, impacting demand at the margin."Separate domestic data showed factory sales falling 1.7% in June from May and home sales down 0.7% in July from June.Canadian bond yields were higher across the curve. The 10-year touched its highest level since November 2008 at 3.803% before dipping to 3.749%, up 6 basis points on the day. (Reporting by Fergal Smith; editing by Barbara Lewis)

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- BlackRock Inc., MSCI Inc. and other firms are bracing for tighter oversight following a congressional probe over investments in Chinese companies deemed to be national security threats and an executive order curtailing specific investments there.More than 2,000 US mutual and exchange-traded funds — particularly those tracking indexes — have $294 billion invested across Chinese stocks and bonds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, though not all of that money is invested in companies facing lawmakers’ scrutiny.Vanguard Group, BlackRock, Fidelity Investments and DWS Group manage funds with investments in China, some of which are the type that Congress is investigating.The Biden administration last Wednesday signed an executive order limiting US investments in China in key technology industries. Separately, on July 31, the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party alleged BlackRock funds are investing in Chinese companies acting against US interests, demanding the asset manager hand over documents about the inclusion of Chinese firms in its funds.The ties between the two countries’ businesses “haven’t frayed as much as a lot in Washington would like,” Martin Chorzempa, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said in a phone interview. Certain lawmakers “would like to push for more of a decoupling.”Last week’s order was narrower than expected, frustrating lawmakers who are pressing for tougher curbs on money flowing to Chinese firms. While the order applies mainly to private equity and venture capital firms, Congress may use the mandate as a springboard to grill money managers about investments in China.Story continuesRead More: Biden Narrows China Investment Order as US Seeks Better TiesThe order is “a baseline that will likely be ratcheted up over time, particularly in terms of covered technology sectors,” Laura Black, senior counsel at Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld law firm, said.‘Bigger Problem’The Biden order restricted investments in semiconductor, quantum computing and artificial intelligence firms, and was narrowed during almost two years of deliberations to a more cautious approach. The order, which will likely take effect next year, may end up excluding passive investments as well as those in publicly traded securities, index funds and other assets.US Representative Mike Gallagher — a Wisconsin Republican and chairman of the House select committee on China — said in an email that he and his colleagues are focusing on publicly listed stocks, bonds and ETFs tied to China.“But the executive order doesn’t touch those,” Gallagher said. “If we want to stop American money funding military contractors and human rights abusers in the PRC [People’s Republic of China], then Congress needs to step up and wrestle with this much bigger problem.”Gallagher and his committee have homed in on BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager, and MSCI, one of the country’s biggest index providers.The select committee on China alleges BlackRock has five funds with more than $429 million invested in Chinese companies acting against US interests.The funds had investments in 20 companies tied to one or more of the government’s watch lists, according to the committee.BlackRock declined to comment, and pointed to an earlier statement that it would respond to the House committee and that it complies with applicable US laws. MSCI said it’s “engaging constructively” with the House committee, and that it doesn’t manage, recommend or facilitate investments in any country.As the world’s largest money manager, BlackRock was more likely to get the spotlight at the beginning of this investigation, according to Todd Rosenbluth, head of research at ETF data and analytics company VettaFi.“BlackRock is one of many asset managers that provide exposure to emerging markets and the Chinese market specifically,” Rosenbluth said. “If this is something for Congress to be concerned about, it is not coming from one index provider and one asset manager — it is a broader industrywide event.”In the past few years, the US government has ramped up oversight of investments in China, spawning a range of government watch lists that asset managers have to navigate.The Defense Department keeps a list identifying Chinese military companies, while the Department of Homeland Security tracks Chinese companies that use forced labor.A third list, managed by the US Treasury, restricts the purchase or sale of securities in certain Chinese military-industrial companies while also allowing money managers and US investors to maintain current holdings in those firms. The Treasury Department says the list doesn’t apply to all of a company’s subsidiaries or related entities.US mutual funds and ETFs have many holdings in securities related to firms on different US government lists because of the different levels of restriction.The $73 billion Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF, for example, has almost a third of its assets allocated to China and has shares of CGN Power Co. Ltd. and Inspur Electronic Information Industry Co. Ltd., according to Bloomberg data as of July 31. These two specific entities aren’t on the Treasury list; China General Nuclear Power Corporation, which Treasury says is known as CGN, and Inspur Group Co. Ltd do appear on the list.DWS Group’s $2.2 billion Xtrackers Harvest CSI 300 China A-Shares ETF has about $8 million in shares of China CSSC Holdings Ltd., according to the Bloomberg data. That entity isn’t on Treasury’s list, while China State Shipbuilding Corporation, which Treasury says is known as CSSC, is on the list.It could get even more complicated to invest in China.US Senators John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, and Bob Casey, a Pennsylvania Democrat, have led the effort to attach a provision to US national defense legislation requiring greater notification about US investments in China. The measure passed the Senate with broad bipartisan support.“We’re complying with applicable US regulations and closely watching developments,” Kenny Juarez, an Xtrackers spokesperson, said in an email.Vanguard is in full compliance with the Treasury list, the company said in a statement. Fidelity declined to comment.--With assistance from David Cohne.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase and the U.S. Virgin Islands traded new accusations this week in legal filings over their relationships with the late disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.The largest U.S. bank detailed how Epstein allegedly funneled hundreds of thousands of dollars in payments and loans to a former U.S. Virgin Islands governor and his wife.The territory in a separate filing cited a 2011 email from a senior JPMorgan executive about suspicious cash withdrawals by Epstein.JPMorgan made its allegations in a filing of more than 610 pages in Manhattan federal court. The filing containing the U.S. Virgin Islands accusations was more than 680 pages.The territory is seeking at least $190 million from JPMorgan over the bank's work for Epstein from 1998 to 2013.While the documents had been previously submitted to the court, the latest filings contain fewer redactions. A trial is scheduled for Oct. 23.JPMorgan said former U.S. Virgin Islands Governor John de Jongh and his wife Cecile had an extensive relationship with Epstein that included the receipt of political donations, employment for Cecile, and a $200,000 loan to the family.The territory, where Epstein owned two neighboring islands, is seeking damages for Epstein's abuse victims.JPMorgan in its filing said the territory failed to show why it deserves "victim damages" when "actual victims" of Epstein will receive money from previously announced settlements.The U.S. Virgin Islands also failed to show that the bank committed obstruction, JPMorgan said.The territory in response quoted a 2011 email from John Duffy, who led JPMorgan's private bank at the time, about Epstein's alleged withdrawals to pay victims."JE and I spoke about his pattern of cash withdrawals," Duffy wrote. "His answer was 'fuel payments in foreign countries.'" Duffy allegedly asked Epstein to use a separate account rather than his personal account for the payments.Story continuesThe territory also quoted an email exchange the prior month between Epstein and Mary Erdoes, who now leads JPMorgan's asset and wealth management business.“Lets [sic] move on, [sic] and make some real money," Epstein wrote."Onwards and upwards, on so many fronts," Erdoes replied.The de Jonghs, Duffy and Erdoes are not parties to the lawsuit. Epstein died by suicide in August 2019 in a Manhattan jail while awaiting trial for sex trafficking.“Rather than account for its own failures to investigate and monitor this criminal under its jurisdiction, USVI blames a bank that did not have USVI's authority to enforce any law,” JPMorgan said in a statement responding to the territory's filing.The bank regretted its association with Epstein, but said it did not aid in his crimes and would not have kept him as a client had it thought he was engaged in sex trafficking.Regarding the loan to the de Jonghs, the U.S. Virgin Islands maintained there was no evidence it gave Epstein favored treatment in exchange for political donations, and said the loan was made "after the former governor left office."(Reporting by Nupur Anand and Tatiana Bautzer in New York; Editing by Lananh Nguyen and David Gregorio)

Text Content: Fisker (FSR) is the latest EV maker to join Tesla’s (TSLA) Supercharger network, though, strangely, not as soon as other Tesla partners.Starting in Q1 2025, Fisker EVs will gain access to 12,000 Tesla Supercharger stations across North America using an adapter (Fisker EVs currently use the Combined Charging System (CCS) plug). Fisker says the company will later “update vehicle engineering” to add the Tesla's North American Charging Standard (NACS) inlet plug to its EVs for direct Supercharger access.Fisker owners — who just started receiving their EVs in the second quarter — will be glad to see the Tesla network added to their charging options. But they'll have to wait until 2025. Other Tesla partners, like GM, Ford, Rivian, and Mercedes to name a few, are getting access to the network in 2024.A Fisker spokesperson did not immediately respond for comment on the matter.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Nonetheless, being added to the Tesla Supercharger network is another win for the company. Earlier this month at its Product Vision Day, Fisker unveiled its future portfolio of EVs through 2026 — which included the Ronin supercar, PEAR crossover, Alaska pickup, and Fisker Ocean with the Force E off-road package.Unlike most other competitors in the pure-play EV space, Fisker is using a contract manufacturer to build its vehicles. Though other automakers use contract manufacturers for some of their products, the Manhattan Beach, California-based Fisker uses contracting giant Magna Steyr's plant in Austria to produce its Ocean SUV, currently the only EV Fisker has on offer.For its upcoming $30,000 PEAR crossover EV, the company is intending to use Taiwan's Foxconn as its contract manufacturer, though earlier this month CEO Henrik Fisker said that arrangement hasn't been finalized.Fisker's Product Vision Day 2023 (credit: Fisker)“The PEAR will be built here, [in the US], but we are still in final talks with Foxconn. When you deal with contract manufacturing, it’s a little different because you have to go through all the details of each vehicle to understand the exact cost of assembly,” Fisker said during the Q2 earnings call.Story continuesIn terms of outlook, Fisker projects that it will produce 20,000-23,000 Ocean EVs this year at the Magna Steyr plant, a reduction of its original 30,000-36,000 target due to “a short-term capacity constraint at one supplier.” It’s the second time this year that Fisker cut its 2023 production target, which originally stood at 42,400 units.Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- The steep drop in output from US shale wells is turning out to be worse than expected, forcing oil drillers to work even harder to keep production from slipping, research firm Enverus said in its latest report.The firm’s conclusion that there won’t be a surge of American oil production comes after the amount of crude extracted from US shale wells doubled in the past decade. The falling output rate over time highlights a fact of life for US shale explorers: oil wells are most prolific in early months of production, with gushers quickly turning to trickles. That reality is why oil output boomed during the shale revolution of the 2010s as companies chased production growth at all costs.Read More: Shrinking Shale Output Sets In as Explorers Dial Back DrillingNow, however, most of the land is already owned or leased, offering few opportunities to drill new areas with vast oil reserves. Companies are considering a range of drilling and production strategies to maximize what they get out of each well such as drilling wells closer together, which makes the shale patch a more dense and difficult place to increase the rate of production.“Summed up, the industry’s treadmill is speeding up and this will make production growth more difficult than it was in the past,” said Dane Gregoris, managing director at Enverus Intelligence Research and author of the report published Tuesday.In the Permian Basin of west Texas and southeast New Mexico, North America’s most productive oil field, the rate of well production in the Midland area has declined by 0.5% each year since 2014. Well production at the nearby Delaware region has fallen by even more since that time.Story continues--With assistance from David Wethe.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Researchers in heavily drilled Pennsylvania were preparing Tuesday to release findings from taxpayer-financed studies on possible links between the natural gas industry and pediatric cancer, asthma and poor birth outcomes.The four-year, $2.5 million project is wrapping up after the state's former governor, Democrat Tom Wolf, in 2019 agreed to commission it under pressure from the families of pediatric cancer patients who live amid the nation's most prolific natural gas reservoir in western Pennsylvania.A number of states have strengthened their laws around fracking and waste disposal over the past decade. However, researchers have repeatedly said that regulatory shortcomings leave an incomplete picture of the amount of toxic substances the industry emits into the air, injects into the ground or produces as waste.The Pennsylvania-funded study involves University of Pittsburgh researchers and comes on the heels of other major studies that are finding higher rates of cancer, asthma, low birth weights and other afflictions among people who live near drilling fields around the country.Tuesday evening's public meeting to discuss the findings will be hosted by University of Pittsburgh School of Public Health and the state Department of Health, on the campus of state-owned Pennsylvania Western University.Edward Ketyer, a retired pediatrician who is president of the Physicians for Social Responsibility Pennsylvania and who sat on an advisory board for the study, said he expects that the studies will be consistent with previous research showing that the “closer you live to fracking activity, the increased risk you have a being sick with a variety of illnesses.”“We’ve got enough evidence that associates, that links, that correlates fracking activity to poor health — and the biggest question is why is anybody surprised about that?” Ketyer said.The gas industry has maintained that fracking is safe and industry groups in Pennsylvania supported Wolf’s initiative to get to the bottom of the pediatric cancer cases.Story continuesThe study's findings are emerging under new Gov. Josh Shapiro, also a Democrat, whose administration has yet to publish or otherwise release the researchers’ reports since taking office earlier this year.The advent of high-volume hydraulic fracturing combined with horizontal drilling miles deep in the ground over the past two decades transformed the United States into a worldwide oil and gas superpower.But it also brought a torrent of complaints about water and air pollution, and diseases and ailments, as it encroached on exurbs and suburbs in states like Texas, Colorado and Pennsylvania.One of the most enduring images of gas drilling pollution was residents in a northern Pennsylvania community lighting their tap water on fire. A state grand jury investigation later found that a company had failed to fix its faulty gas wells, which leaked flammable methane into residential water supplies in surrounding communities.The Pennsylvania-funded study comes on the heels of other major studies, such as one published last year by Harvard University researchers who said they found evidence of higher death rates in more than 15 million Medicare beneficiaries who lived downwind of oil and gas wells in major exploration regions around the U.S.Yale University researchers last year said they found that children in Pennsylvania living near an oil or gas wellsite had up to two to three times the odds of developing acute lymphocytic leukemia, a common type of cancer in children.Establishing the cause of health problems is challenging, however. It can be difficult or impossible for researchers to determine exactly how much exposure people had to pollutants in air or water, and scientists often cannot rule out other contributing factors.Because of that, environmental health researchers try to gather enough data to gauge risk and draw conclusions.“The idea is we’re collecting evidence in some kind of a systematic way and we’re looking at that evidence and judging whether causation is a reasonable interpretation to make,” said David Ozonoff, a retired environmental health professor who chaired the Department of Environmental Health at Boston University.Another key piece of evidence is to identify an activity that exposes people to a chemical as part of assembling evidence that fits together in narrative, Ozonoff said.___Follow Marc Levy on Twitter: http://twitter.com/timelywriter

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Pentwater Capital Management LP led hedge funds boosting stakes in Activision Blizzard Inc. last quarter before a make-or-break July court decision on the video-game maker’s proposed $69 billion merger with Microsoft Corp.Pentwater, among the best-known firms that focus on event-driven strategies including merger arbitrage, added about 5.87 million shares in the period — more than any other hedge fund — according to quarterly filing data compiled by Bloomberg. That brought its position to 21.3 million shares, which would be worth roughly $1.9 billion at current prices if the firm still holds the shares.Read More: Pentwater Adds Triton International, Exits WWE Class A: 13FJericho Capital Asset Management, Balyasny Asset Management and Citadel Advisors also lifted their holdings last quarter, by at least 2 million shares each. Pentwater and some of the other funds also had options positions in Activision that may have been aimed at hedging the share holdings, the filings show.The funds’ move to increase the stock positions came before Microsoft won a court fight with US regulators in July, effectively ending months of uncertainty over whether the largest gaming deal ever could survive antitrust scrutiny.With the merger moving closer to the finish line, Activision shares have rallied about 8% since the end of June to about $91 on Tuesday. Microsoft offered to buy the company at $95 a share.

Text Content: By Jamie McGeever(Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in Asian markets from Jamie McGeever, financial markets columnist.The word 'crisis' should always be used responsibly and judiciously when covering financial markets, business and economics, but are we at that point now with China?Developments in the last 24 hours from the world's second largest economy - another string of top-tier data 'misses', a shock interest rate cut and an abrupt announcement that (record high) youth unemployment data will no longer be published - suggest we might be.The deepening concern around China's economy, policy options and financial markets will weigh heavily on Asian investor sentiment on Wednesday, with an interest rate decision from New Zealand and the latest manufacturing and service sector 'tankan' surveys from Japan also on tap.It's not all doom and gloom in Asia - Japan's economy grew twice as fast in the second quarter as economists had expected - but China's travails are front and center right now.Perhaps even more worrying for investors than the misses on investment, industrial production and retail sales, or the surprise rate cut, was Beijing's decision to suspend the publication of youth unemployment figures for an unspecified length of time.The official rate in June was a record 21.3%. That's bad enough, but in an online post last month - since removed - Peking University professor Zhang Dandan estimated it could be closer to 50%.The latest snapshot of Chinese house prices will be released on Wednesday, and again, another weak report could be in store, with the country's property sector in a genuine state of crisis.JP Morgan on Tuesday said if developer Country Garden suffers a full-scale default, it will more than double China's year-to-date property default tally to $17 billion, adding to the $100 billion racked up over the past two and a half years.The People's Bank of China may have finally pulled the interest rate lever, but it had the expected impact of slamming the exchange rate. The offshore yuan tumbled through 7.30 per dollar to its weakest level this year and is now flirting with November's historic low of around 7.35 per dollar.Story continuesCompare and contrast China with Japan, as per Tuesday's bumper Q2 GDP data, and the U.S., where figures on Tuesday showed a surge in retail sales. The Atlanta Fed's GDPNow model is projecting annualized Q3 growth of 5.0%.Global stocks, Wall Street and emerging markets all buckled on Tuesday under the weight of rising bond yields, 'higher for longer' Fed rate expectations and a buoyant dollar.The MSCI Asia ex-Japan index fell for a fourth day and has now only risen twice in the last 11 sessions. Among the biggest losers in Asia on Tuesday was Hong Kong's mainland property index, which fell 1% to take its year-to-date decline to 16%.Here are key developments that could provide more direction to markets on Wednesday:- New Zealand interest rate decision- China house prices (July)- Japan tankan surveys (August)(By Jamie McGeever; Editing by Josie Kao)

Text Content: By Abigail SummervilleNEW YORK (Reuters) - Private equity firm Bain Capital on Tuesday agreed to buy Fogo de Chão, in a deal people familiar with the matter said valued the Brazilian steakhouse chain at about $1.1 billion, including debt.The deal marks a win for private equity firm Rhone Capital, which took Fogo de Chão private for $560 million in 2018. Rhône made more than three times the money it invested in the restaurant operator, the sources said, requesting anonymity as the matter is confidential.Under Rhone's ownership, Fogo de Chão's financial performance improved and it has posted annual revenue growth of 15% since 2021.Prior to its sale, Rhone had explored re-listing Fogo de Chão's shares on stock exchanges. The restaurant chain confidentially submitted paperwork for an initial public offering to regulators in late 2021, the sources said.However, it started exploring a sale instead as the U.S. IPO market collapsed in early 2021 and went through an arid spell that lasted a year and a half, forcing several companies to postpone their attempts to go public, the sources said.Rhône, Fogo de Chão and Bain declined to comment.Founded in Southern Brazil in 1979, Fogo has a presence in 76 locations worldwide. Bain Capital has a long history of investing in the restaurant industry and has backed several big names, including Burger King, Dunkin’ Brands Inc, Domino’s Pizza Inc and Bloomin’ Brands Inc.Fogo de Chão's sale comes amid a recent uptick in dealmaking in the restaurant industry. Sandwich chain Subway has been exploring a sale that could be completed in the coming weeks, while Benihana Inc has also been working with advisers to sell itself.Earlier in August, the Pollo Tropical restaurant chain was sold to Authentic Restaurant Brands for $225 million.Bain arranged debt financing for the deal from Deutsche Bank, which is also serving as financial advisor to the firm. Kirkland & Ellis served as legal counsel to Bain.Morgan Stanley & Co LLC is serving as the exclusive financial advisor to Fogo de Chão and Rhône, with Sullivan & Cromwell is serving as legal counsel.(Reporting by Abigail Summerville in New York; Editing by Anirban Sen and Jonathan Oatis)

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- For the second straight month, a slew of disappointing economic data from China spurred investment banks around the world to cut their 2023 growth outlook.The wave of downgrades highlights the danger of the world’s second-biggest economy missing its official target of around 5% expansion for this year, without more concerted policy actions. The latest reductions by private-sector economists followed an announcement of interest-rate cuts by the central bank.JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s team lowered its full-year forecast for 2023 to a 4.8% gain for gross domestic product. As recently as early May, the bank had been predicting a 6.4% expansion, among the highest calls.The JPMorgan economists, led by Haibin Zhu, now anticipate a 4.2% growth pace for next year. After China’s relatively paltry 3% expansion last year, that would leave the country with its first three straight years of sub-5% growth since the era of Mao Zedong, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Read More: Surprise China Rate Cut Only Highlights Tough Choices Facing XiFor its part, Barclays Plc cut its GDP growth estimate by 0.4 percentage points, to 4.5% for this year, while maintaining a below-consensus 2024 projection of 4%.Barclays economists including Jian Chang attributed the move to disappointing data on consumption, housing, exports and credit, as well as the absence of effective stimulus.On Tuesday, official activity data for July showed growth in consumer spending, industrial output and investment sliding across the board and unemployment picking up. A similarly disappointing set of data for June had triggered a number of banks to reduce their full-year forecasts last month.Story continuesAmong those trimming predictions this time is Mizuho Financial Group Inc. The big Japanese lender reduced its full-year GDP growth projection to 5% from 5.5%. Serena Zhou, the bank’s senior China economist, cited headwinds from continuing weakness in the property market.JPMorgan also highlighted China’s real estate woes. “The deterioration in housing market outlook, especially another year of big decline in land purchase and new home starts, tends to increase the drag” on the economy, the bank’s economists said.They also cited concerns about giant developer Country Garden missing a bond coupon payment recently — a move that will likely further erode market confidence and intensify the spillover risk across portions of China’s financial sector.Read More: China’s $138 Billion Shadow Bank Spirals at Terrible Time for XiThe National Bureau of Statistics itself on Tuesday stated that domestic demand remained “insufficient” and that the “economy’s recovery foundation still needs to be strengthened.”Other recent data have shown the weakest pace of bank lending in 14 years, the emergence of deflationary pressures and a contraction in exports.Not everyone’s cutting forecasts. Standard Chartered Plc said it’s keeping its full-year projection at 5.4%.“Despite a weak start” to the third quarter, “we still think China can achieve its GDP growth target of about 5%,” economists including Wei Li and Ding Shuang wrote in a note. They anticipate “a reopening boost to the services sector, and increased policy stimulus.”Others standing pat still cited risks to their outlook. Among them: Morgan Stanley. “If easing remains slow,” then the official 5% target will be at risk, economists including Robin Xing said.Further monetary and fiscal measures, along with a relaxation of rules for the property market, could help growth rebound in the second half of this year, UBS Group AG economists led by Tao Wang wrote. They maintained a full-year GDP growth forecast at 5.2% in a baseline scenario.“The data weakness is hardly a surprise, and the more important thing to watch should be policy delivery at this stage,” Citigroup Inc. economists including Xiangrong Yu wrote after Tuesday’s releases. “To meet the growth target, we are in a race between policies and the economy.”--With assistance from George Lei.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Ethanol inventories are rising in Brazil as drivers embrace cheaper gasoline, delivering an earnings blow to the nation’s large sugar-cane producers and prompting a pivot toward higher sugar output.Ethanol stockpiles from Brazil’s top producer, Raizen SA, more than doubled in second quarter from the prior three-month period as the firm curtailed sales in hopes of better pricing, Chief Financial Officer Carlos Moura told journalists on Tuesday. He said Raizen is reacting by increasing sugar output as much as it can.A slump in Raizen’s biofuel business hurt its second-quarter results and contributed to Monday’s earnings miss, following a similar trend reported by rivals Sao Martinho SA and Jalles Machado SA. Sales of 100% ethanol fuel dropped 9% in July, according to industry group Unica, which Jalles Machado estimates elevated total stockpiles in the South American nation by 5% from the prior year.Recent dry weather could allow producers to allocate a bigger share of the cane juice to make sweetener. That could boost sugar supplies when the group is already crushing more cane this season. Raizen said it may process 80 to 83 million tons of cane, more than the 74 million from last year.Read More: Brazil Ramps Up Sugar Capacity as Drought Threatens World SupplyWhile biofuels make for a huge part of Brazil’s economy, ethanol demand has weakened with prices recently becoming less competitive to gasoline. Most of the country’s cars can run on any mix of gasoline or ethanol, so lower gasoline prices reduce consumers’ appetite to fill up tanks with ethanol.The sugar industry’s hopes now rely on a shift in direction after oil giant Petroleo Brasileiro SA raised fuel prices. The increases, announced Tuesday, are seen by Raizen’s Chief Executive Officer Ricardo Mussa as a positive sign to keep local fuel prices in line with international markets, offsetting fears that the state-controlled company would freeze rates to tame inflation.Story continues©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: (Updates market activity, tweaks headline.) By Karen Brettell and David Randall NEW YORK, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields hit an almost 10-month high on Tuesday before quickly dipping, after data showed July retail sales rose more than expected. Retail sales jumped 0.7% last month, above the 0.4% forecast. June data was revised higher to show sales rising 0.3% instead of the previously reported 0.2%. Americans boosted online purchases and dined out more, suggesting the U.S. economy continues to expand and putting recession fears at bay. Resilient U.S. data has also boosted expectations that the Federal Reserve may hold interest rates higher for longer to bring inflation down closer to its 2% annual target. Markets have priced in "a considerably higher probability that we stay around the current terminal rate for a longer period than was previously expected," said Jonathan Cohn, head of U.S. rates desk strategy at Nomura in New York. Benchmark 10-year yields hit 4.274%, the highest since Oct. 24, before settling at 4.215% in afternoon trading. Two-year yields reached 5.024%, the highest since July 7, before retreating to 4.952%. The interest rate-sensitive notes are holding below the 5.120% yield reached on July 6, the highest since June 2007. The inversion in the closely watched yield curve between two- and 10-year notes narrowed to minus 74 basis points. The Fed will release minutes from its July 25-26 meeting on Wednesday. The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City's annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, on Aug. 24-26 could also deliver clarity on Fed thinking. Futures markets are now pricing in a nearly 35% chance that the Fed's benchmark rate will be above its current range at its December meeting, up from a roughly 25% chance seen a month ago. The market is evaluating "how far the sell-off can run" before the Fed releases minutes of its previous meeting Thursday afternoon, said Benjamin Jeffery, U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets.

Text Content: MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) — An auto parts supplier plans a $114 million investment to expand its facility in Alabama to support the production of electric vehicle parts, Gov. Kay Ivey's office announced Tuesday.Shinhwa Auto USA Corp.'s expansion will create 50 jobs over the next three years and add a 170,000-square foot production building on the company's site in Auburn Technology Park West, officials said. The average salary of workers at the plant will be about $48,000, the Alabama Department of Commerce said.“Shinhwa’s constant growth in Auburn demonstrates Alabama, through high levels of innovation and technical prowess, is preparing for an evolving future," Ivey said in a news release.“Shinhwa’s story here in Auburn is evidence of the work generations of leaders have done to make our community not only welcoming to but also fertile ground for businesses,” Auburn Mayor Ron Anders said. “We’re grateful for Shinhwa’s investment in Auburn and look forward to seeing them continue to thrive.”With this new investment project, Shinhwa plans to increase capacity by expanding die-casting operations and adding associated processes that are required to make control arm, knuckle, carrier and motor housing covers in support of Hyundai, Kia and other automakers in the U.S., the news release said.“As one of the most innovative industrial manufacturers of aluminum car components, we are confident that the momentum we have achieved will continue to meet customers’ growing demand for high-quality products,” said Kwi Hyun Lee, chairman of Shinhwa Group.The expansion will be the South Korean company’s third since choosing Auburn as the site of its first U.S. plant in 2019. The company did not immediately say when the project would begin or was expected to be completed.

Source: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fed-interest-rate-debate-shifting-090000404.html
Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- As Federal Reserve officials close in on the end of their tightening campaign, the debate is shifting from how high interest rates need to go to how long they should stay elevated.Inflation pressures are easing, which could give policymakers room to keep interest rates at or near current levels for the time being. Still, price gains remain well above the central bank’s 2% target, making policymakers hesitant to declare victory.Introducing the discussion over how long officials may keep rates steady even if inflation continues to decelerate could help them push back on expectations for rate cuts and allow them to keep putting downward pressure on the economy.“This is the policy dimension that they will likely focus on the most going forward: Not how much higher to take the federal funds rate, but how long to keep it at these levels,” said Brian Sack, a former senior Fed official who earlier this year left D.E. Shaw & Co. after about a decade as head of the investment firm’s global economics group. “There’s still a lot of scope to tighten financial conditions in that way, if they wanted to.”Fed officials unanimously raised their benchmark rate last month to a target range of 5.25% to 5.5%, the highest level in 22 years. Minutes from that gathering — set for release on Wednesday afternoon — could provide more insight into whether most policymakers believe those increases have already worked their way through the economy or if they still expect to see more effects.Data ImprovingRecent data suggest inflation is moving in the direction policymakers favor. The core consumer price index, which excludes often-volatile food and energy costs, rose 0.2% in July for a second month, marking the smallest back-to-back gains in more than two years. Consumers’ year-ahead inflation expectations also unexpectedly declined in early August, matching a more than two-year low.Story continuesPolicymakers are not unified on what their immediate steps should be, with some such as Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker saying officials can hold rates where they are “for a while” and others, including Fed Governor Michelle Bowman, saying more increases will be needed.“Are we done raising rates? I’m not ready to say that we’re done,” Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said Tuesday. “But I’m seeing positive signs that say, hey, we may be on our way — we can take a little bit more time to see, get some more data and before we decide whether we need to do more.”Read More: Kashkari Says Inflation Rate Too High, But Fed Sees ProgressSome officials are downplaying the significance of another potential rate increase, saying the more important takeaway is that they plan to hold rates at restrictive levels.“I think we’re pretty close to what a peak rate would be,” New York Fed President John Williams told the New York Times this month. “And the question will really be — once we have a good understanding of that — how long will we need to keep policy in a restrictive stance.”Goldman Sachs Group Inc. economists including Jan Hatzius and David Mericle anticipate the Fed will start lowering interest rates by the end of June, they wrote in a note dated Aug. 13.A Bloomberg survey of 45 economists conducted July 13-18 showed participants are split on when the first cut will occur. More than one-quarter see a reduction in January 2024, while the median of the group sees the first cut at the following meeting in March, with rates falling to 4.75% by June 2024.Officials haven’t clarified yet how long they plan to keep rates stable, in part because they haven’t figured it out themselves, said Tim Duy, chief US economist for SGH Macro Advisors. It’s a question some policymakers could tackle when they gather at the Kansas City Fed’s annual Jackson Hole symposium this month.“The conversation we’re seeing among presidents now, among Fed speakers, is going to be reflective of what’s going to be likely the sideline chatter of Jackson Hole,” said Duy. “We’re transitioning into the next part of this story.”Median economic projections released in June showed that most Fed officials expected rates to go up by at least another quarter point, on top of the rate increase approved in July. The forecasts also show policymakers anticipate cutting rates to 4.6% by the end of 2024, according to their median projection, but it’s not clear when those cuts would begin.Investors are largely expecting the Fed to hold rates steady when they gather on Sept. 19-20 and see about a one-in-three chance for a quarter-point hike in November, according to pricing in futures markets.Officials are reluctant to limit their options until the inflation data show price pressures are decidedly easing. Reports reflecting stable job gains and robust economic growth have led to lower recession odds, but also threaten to reaccelerate price growth.“I don’t think Powell is ready to completely close the door on that last increase,” said Ellen Meade, an economics professor at Duke University and former senior Fed staff member.Still, officials are starting to informally discuss how long they’ll hold rates elevated so they can start debating the trade-offs they’ll need to consider. Once the committee agrees that they are done hiking, Powell will work with officials on the language that will eventually make its way into the policy statement, she said.“They need to have those conversations today so that when they get to tomorrow, they’re ready,” said Meade. “They’re always anticipating what might be the next thing on their agenda.”--With assistance from Reade Pickert.(Updates with Kashkari comments in eighth paragraph.)©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Lawmakers are assessing ways to mitigate the potential harms - particularly to national security - while taking advantage of its strengths.The group is to be headed by Representative Derek Kilmer, a Democrat from Washington state.Vice chairs are Representatives Don Beyer of Virginia, Jeff Jackson from North Carolina, Sara Jacobs of California, Susie Lee of Nevada and Haley Stevens from Michigan.In July, the White House announced that AI companies including OpenAI, Alphabet and Meta Platforms had made voluntary commitments to implement measures such as watermarking AI-generated content to help make the technology safer.In the Senate, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said last month that lawmakers would hear from developers, executives and experts later this year on possible legislative safeguards.(Reporting by Diane Bartz; Editing by Nick Macfie)

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- European equities slipped in a day of light trading, as China’s central bank decision to unexpectedly cut a key interest rate failed to reassure markets about the country’s economic outlook, while UK blue-chips underperformed following record UK wage growth.The Stoxx Europe 600 declined 0.9% in London, closing at its lowest level in over a month, with volumes 33% below the average for the past 30 days. The People’s Bank of China lowered rates to bolster an economy that’s facing fresh risks, stoking concerns about the impact on global growth. The surprise move came shortly before the release of disappointing economic activity data for July.In the US, data showed retail sales rose in July by more than forecast, highlighting how the resilience of consumers is helping to power the economy forward.In Europe, real estate and consumer products lagged. Among individual movers, Marks & Spencer Group Plc jumped after raising its outlook, predicting profit growth in 2023 as it gains market share in groceries, clothing and homeware. Jeweler Pandora A/S also gained after boosting its organic revenue forecast for the full year.“Although policymakers are rightly looking to prevent a meltdown in China, we think the property sector problems are a reflection of a structural downturn which will shape the Chinese economy for years to come,” said Susana Cruz, a strategist at Liberum Capital. “In any case, weakness in the property and consumer sectors in China will have repercussions for European and UK companies.”The FTSE 100 fell as the pound initially gained after UK wage growth accelerated at the strongest pace on record, underscoring the Bank of England’s concerns that it hasn’t yet broken the wage-price spiral feeding inflation across the economy.Story continuesEuropean stocks have given back part of the year’s gains this month as concerns about China’s economic woes, especially in the real estate market, and rates peaking higher than expected take hold. August has also typically been a negative month for the Stoxx 600 over the past decade.For more on equity markets:You want more news on this market?

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Oil plunged to the lowest in almost two weeks on growing concerns that China’s faltering economy will erode demand in the world’s biggest importer of crude.US oil futures settled below $81 a barrel in thin trading, dropping in tandem with equities and defying strength in underlying physical markets. An unexpected interest-rate cut by China’s central bank underscored issues besetting Beijing, from a worsening property slump and weak consumer spending to fears over shadow banking.“Oil markets are suffering from economic growth concerns,” said Giovanni Staunovo, an analyst at UBS Group AG. “Chinese economic data continues to disappoint, while in the US economic data — retail sales — came in on the stronger side, with market participants concerned that requires even higher policy rates from the Fed.”The weakening sentiment comes despite physical markets continuing to flash signs of strength. Crude inventories at the Cushing, Oklahoma, hub are seen draining to their lowest level since April, while Asian refineries continue to ramp up imports. Supplies have become increasingly tight since late June as OPEC+ kingpins Saudi Arabia and Russia cut production, helping to drain stockpiles. Both crude benchmarks are still trading steeply in backwardation, a market structure that signals near-term supply tightness.Consumption also has been more robust than many observers expected. The International Energy Agency estimates global demand has been running at a record pace, and in the US, the Energy Information Administration figures showed record levels of usage seasonally.But the rally has fizzled in recent trading sessions on growing concerns that Chinese demand has already peaked for the year. Consumer spending and industrial output has disappointed, unemployment has picked up and turmoil in the shadow banking industry is sparking wider fears over the country’s economic health.Story continuesTo get Bloomberg’s Energy Daily newsletter direct into your inbox, click here.--With assistance from Rachel Graham and Alaric Nightingale.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: By Carolina PuliceMEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Gabriella Batalha didn't think much when she noticed she had been logged out of Instagram - until the next day when she found her account overrun with sensational posts touting high-yield cryptocurrency investments.To recover her account, the 27-year-old lawyer from Rio de Janeiro had to pay 200 reais ($40) to a "consultant" she found on YouTube, a man she says could have been a scammer himself."It took me two days to recover my account, and I was under a lot of stress," she said.Batalha is not alone. Online scams in Brazil jumped 65% last year to over 200,000, according to data from the Brazilian Public Security Yearbook published last month.And across Latin America, online frauds and cyberattacks are at an "all-time high," says cybersecurity company Tenable, posing an urgent problem for a well-connected region.Latin America's recent progress on technological inclusion has created new opportunities for scams, experts say, with the pandemic fueling a trend toward mobile banking and shopping using payment systems like Brazil's hugely popular PIX.The region is increasingly online. In 2022, 77.9% of the population in Latin America and the Caribbean used the internet, up from 74.8% the year before and above the global rate of 66.3%, according to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU).And nearly half of Latin American internet users spend an average of six hours a day on social media, according to a report by cybersecurity company Kaspersky."The increasing reliance on new technology has made it easier for cybercriminals to attack more frequently," said Kerry-Ann Barrett, a cybersecurity specialist at the Organization of American States (OAS).The threats are increasingly complex and costly, costing the region billions annually, Barrett said.In Peru, for example, a gang scammed a construction company out of over $62,000 by pretending to be a bank with a fake website, according to the attorney general's office.Story continuesIn Mexico, scammers have targeted unsuspecting victims with fake job offers via text message, only to entice victims to share sensitive personal data, according to media reports."Latin America is a priority target because it has a very connected population, which means that they are always exposed," said Claudio Martinelli, managing director for Latin America for Kaspersky.Institutions and governments are also more vulnerable than in other parts of the world. In a ranking of 93 countries on cyberthreat risks compiled by fraud prevention software SEON, nine of the 10 Latin American countries were ranked in the bottom half.Three Latin American countries - Honduras, Nicaragua and Venezuela - were seen among the 10 countries with the highest risks for cyberthreats.The region, meanwhile, had the highest share of unprotected data in the world in 2022, Tenable said, making companies vulnerable to threats like ransomware, a kind of attack that locks a computer and then demands money for its release.Ransomware was responsible for six of every 10 attacks in 2022, including an attack on Costa Rica's finance ministry by Russian hackers, who demanded $10 million.Latin America's ability to safeguard against future attacks is handicapped by a lack of regulation and judicial investigations, said Marcos Simplicio, a professor specializing in cybersecurity at the University of Sao Paulo."Virtual crime is no different from physical crime," he said. "As long as it's making a profit, and if there is little chance of punishment, it will continue."(Reporting by Carolina Pulice; Additional reporting by Brendan O'Boyle; Editing by Brendan O'Boyle and Nick Macfie)

Text Content: By Abigail SummervilleNEW YORK, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Private equity firm Bain Capital on Tuesday agreed to buy Fogo de Chão, in a deal people familiar with the matter said valued the Brazilian steakhouse chain at about $1.1 billion, including debt.The deal marks a win for private equity firm Rhone Capital, which took Fogo de Chão private for $560 million in 2018. Rhône made more than three times the money it invested in the restaurant operator, the sources said, requesting anonymity as the matter is confidential.Under Rhone's ownership, Fogo de Chão's financial performance improved and it has posted annual revenue growth of 15% since 2021.Prior to its sale, Rhone had explored re-listing Fogo de Chão's shares on stock exchanges. The restaurant chain confidentially submitted paperwork for an initial public offering to regulators in late 2021, the sources said.However, it started exploring a sale instead as the U.S. IPO market collapsed in early 2021 and went through an arid spell that lasted a year and a half, forcing several companies to postpone their attempts to go public, the sources said.Rhône, Fogo de Chão and Bain declined to comment.Founded in Southern Brazil in 1979, Fogo has a presence in 76 locations worldwide. Bain Capital has a long history of investing in the restaurant industry and has backed several big names, including Burger King, Dunkin’ Brands Inc, Domino’s Pizza Inc and Bloomin’ Brands Inc.Fogo de Chão's sale comes amid a recent uptick in dealmaking in the restaurant industry. Sandwich chain Subway has been exploring a sale that could be completed in the coming weeks, while Benihana Inc has also been working with advisers to sell itself.Earlier in August, the Pollo Tropical restaurant chain was sold to Authentic Restaurant Brands for $225 million.Bain arranged debt financing for the deal from Deutsche Bank, which is also serving as financial advisor to the firm. Kirkland & Ellis served as legal counsel to Bain.Morgan Stanley & Co LLC is serving as the exclusive financial advisor to Fogo de Chão and Rhône, with Sullivan & Cromwell is serving as legal counsel.

Text Content: By Leticia FucuchimaSAO PAULO, Aug 15 (Reuters) - The unexpected resignation of Eletrobras chief executive Wilson Ferreira Junior is likely to throw Latin America's largest utility into uncertainty and weigh on its shares in the short term, analysts said.Ferreira tendered his resignation on Monday after less than a year in the role, leading shares in Eletrobras to dip nearly 4% on Tuesday. He was replaced by Ivan Monteiro, the former chief of state-run oil company Petrobras.Some analysts expect Monteiro to maintain the Eletrobras strategy adopted under Ferreira, but his still not fully explained departure has raised doubts.Ferreira was key in the privatization of Eletrobras, concluded last year when the government diluted its stake in the utility.He first led the company from 2016 to early 2021, when he was appointed to oversee the privatization. After a brief stint at fuel distributor Vibra, Ferreira returned to Eletrobras in late 2022.In a note to clients, JPMorgan analysts wrote that the Eletrobras statement announcing Ferreira's departure lacked details and prompted speculation as to why he would forsake a generous compensation package."We believe his departure is indeed due to personal reasons, but we cannot discard other possibilities," they said, including potential pressure from Brazil's new leftist government.Earlier this year, President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's administration asked the supreme court to grant it voting power in Eletrobras proportional to its stake.The government owns about 43% of Eletrobras' common shares, but shareholders are prohibited by law from exercising voting power greater than 10%.Analysts said Tuesday's sell-off was not as strong as some feared, as Monteiro has the support of some investors.In a statement, Itau BBA described him as a "well-regarded executive" who gained valuable experience as an Eletrobras board member.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- European natural gas futures spiked for the second time in less than a week, with market tensions running high over the possibility of strikes in Australia that could severely tighten the global market.Discussions on Tuesday between union officials and Woodside Energy Group Ltd., one of the two companies operating the affected liquefied natural gas facilities, yielded no firm outcome to the labor dispute.Traders are closely monitoring the talks for any sign of resolution — or timetable if the strikes move forward — as the work stoppage threatens to disrupt as much as 10% of global LNG supplies. While Europe rarely buys Australian gas, it would need to compete with Asia for a limited amount of cargoes, with the winter heating season starting in less than two months.The benchmark Dutch contract settled 13% higher after soaring as much as 18% earlier Tuesday. Futures surged 28% on Aug. 9, amid the growing possibility of walkouts at several LNG facilities.“Any signs of strike action going ahead could cause a bullish run up to and into the start of winter over fears of supply disruptions,” analysts at Inspired Plc wrote in a note.While the discussions resulted in some progress, the two sides weren’t yet close to an agreement ahead of a potential strike decision for Friday, energy news provider Montel reported. A Woodside Energy spokesperson said they haven’t been notified of industrial action as yet.“A full resolution is unlikely to be reached without the full support of the Offshore Alliance, and recent social media posts from the union indicate that we are still some way away from this,” said Leo Kabouche, an LNG analyst at Energy Aspects Ltd. in London.Story continuesWith the threat of possible strikes looming, the Gorgon facility operated by Chevron Corp. in Australia is already holding back from some spot market sales, traders with knowledge of the situation told Bloomberg News.Separately, natural gas deliveries to the Corpus Christi liquefaction terminal in the US fell to 1.6 billion cubic feet a day, according to BNEF’s LNG Feedgas Model, adding to strains on global supplies.Even though Europe’s gas inventories are well-above the season norm, the region is vulnerable to possible delays in the summer maintenance schedules of major producers, such as Norway. Traders are also eyeing a rise in temperatures in southern Europe, Germany and France that could lead to a spike in demand for cooling.Dutch front-month futures, Europe’s gas benchmark settled at €38.81 a megawatt-hour.

Text Content: Baby boomers born from 1960 to 1965 are in big trouble when it comes to retirement savings.The so-called late boomers, nearing retirement, have less wealth than earlier boomer cohorts, according to a new brief published by the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College.Late boomers have low levels of wealth regardless of how it's defined—total wealth, retirement wealth, and 401(k)/IRA wealth. The average amount in a direct contribution plan, such as a 401(k), 403(b) or IRA, for this cadre of boomers was $32,700 compared to $52,300 for mid boomers – those born between 1954 to 1959. Total retirement wealth for late boomers was $299,703 vs. $350,449 for those just a few years older, according to the findings.This difference "is unprecedented," Anqi Chen, one of the brief’s co-authors and a senior research economist at the Center for Retirement Research, told Yahoo Finance.The key reason they've fallen behind? "The Great Recession (Dec. 2007-June 2009) hit late boomers during their peak earning years between the ages of 42 and 49," Chen said. "This was meant to be an age when late boomers earned the most and saved more for retirement. But because...many lost their jobs, or had to accept lower-paying jobs, (they) were less likely to participate in a 401(k). So they could not accumulate enough, setting many of them back.""They have never recovered," she added.Other factors: a rising share of Black and Hispanic households who earn less than their White counterparts and a declining share of households that are married and have college degrees.In reality, these late boomers were expected to have some extra lifting to do. A shift from traditional pension plans to direct contribution plans, like 401(k) plans, has hurt. For this subset of boomers, the responsibility to save at work for their own retirement fell squarely onto their shoulders.And, in time, the impact of the change in the Social Security full retirement age was anticipated to lead to a dip in retirement wealth to some extent. The 1983 overhaul of Social Security gradually raised the age from 65 to 67, which it reached in 2022 for those born in 1960 or later — effectively cutting benefits by 13 percent.Story continuesBut the enduring backlash from the Great Recession was a surprise.Read and weep? (Getty Creative)Better late than never? There are still ways late boomers can boost savings.One thing: make retirement savings automatic from every paycheck and set the amount by a percentage of income, not a dollar amount, Lisa A.K. Kirchenbauer, the founder of Omega Wealth Management in Arlington, Va., told Yahoo Finance. "That will help the dollar amount grow as people get salary increases."Also being "strategic about bonuses – spend some, save some – is a good way for late boomers to feel like they are having their cake and eating it too," she added.Consulting with a certified financial planner, or using an online calculator will "help create some urgency around what you should actually be saving, even if it has to be an inspirational goal for now," Kirchenbauer said.Retirement calculators are widely available online and they are great tools to help people get a sense of whether they are on track.

More than a third (36%) of those surveyed by the nonprofit Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies said as much."In theory, envisioning working longer and retiring later sounds like an ideal solution to not having enough retirement savings," Catherine Collinson, CEO and president of Transamerica Institute and TCRS, said. "However, it can be very difficult to achieve in practice, especially if you're not...keeping your job skills up to date."In other words: Start planning for that possibility now by taking classes to learn new skills and keep existing ones honed.Also don’t neglect the over age 50 catch-up for your retirement fund contributions, Eric Park, a certified financial planner at LPL Financial in Washington, Mo., advised.Pickleball passion: But can they afford the paddles? (Getty Creative)Retirement contributions for 2023Workers who have a 401(k), 403(b), most 457 plans, and the federal government's Thrift Savings Plan can contribute up to $22,500 this year in their employer-provided retirement plans. Folks 50 and over can save an additional $7,500. In total, workers who are 50 and older can contribute up to $30,000 to tax-deferred retirement plans, this year.The annual contribution limit for an IRA is $6,500 this year. Individuals 50 and over can save an additional $1,000 to IRAs, on top of that.Although the funds are taxed when withdrawn, the compounding of the tax-deferred rate of return can juice up balances above that set aside in taxable accounts with identical investments."Details matter a lot in the final landing pass to retirement," Park said. "This is the wrong time to make a mistake, getting professional, objective advice is critical, but be careful who you get advice from, there are no do-overs or mulligans when you’re this close."Kerry Hannon is a Senior Reporter and Columnist at Yahoo Finance.

Source: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/municipal-bonds-outperform-investors-rush-162613539.html
Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- A reluctance by states and cities to borrow is making municipal debt a star performer among credit assets and driving investors to scour the market for bonds.Municipalities issued $218 billion of long-term debt year to date, 9% less than at the same point last year and the slowest pace of sales since 2019, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Federal Reserve’s interest-rate increase regime since March 2022 to fight inflation at least partly explains the dropoff.The scarcity is fueling outperformance in the asset class. Municipal bonds returned 0.4% in July, better than a 0.35% decline in US Treasuries, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Month to date, munis lost 0.8%, less than Treasuries and corporates, which lost 1.2% and 1.8% respectively.“Tight supply has pushed municipal bond valuations toward lofty levels,” Wells Fargo Investment Institute strategist Luis Alvarado wrote in a note published Monday. “For long-term municipal investors, we would view periods of market weakness as an opportunity to add to positions.”With few new bonds available, portfolio managers have become reluctant to sell their current holdings. This market stasis is providing a tailwind for bond prices even as mutual funds, the core buyer of state and local debt, struggle to attract consistent inflows.Investors ‘Starved’“It’s keeping turnover more muted in the portfolio because there are fewer securities to source in the new issue market,” said Wesly Pate, senior portfolio manager at Income Research + Management in Boston. “The muni market is effectively starved for bonds.”The competition among investors can be seen in the growing demand for state and local government bonds that have come to market. In July, deals were oversubscribed by 5.2 times on average, according to a research note by BlackRock Inc., above the year-to-date average of 4 times.Story continuesGreg Gizzi, head of municipal bonds at Macquarie Asset Management, sees two main reasons for the slowdown. Issuer balance sheets are fairly healthy, diminishing their need to borrow, and some issuers may be deterred by interest rate volatility. The summer is typically a period of weak supply, he added.Not all issuers time their borrowing to the market. Tennessee is planning to issue debt this week partly to fund a grant to finance a new Nashville stadium project for the Tennessee Titans of the National Football League. Sandi Thompson, the director of state government finance for the Tennessee Comptroller of the Treasury, said that the timing was based around the calendars of other government agencies, rather than the market.“Just because rates are going up and down, we don’t play the market, we just do what we’re supposed to do, procedurally,” Thompson said. A decline in refinancings given high interest rates has also squeezed supply, she added.For all these reasons, there’s been little turnover of bonds by investors. Average daily bid-wanted activity fell more than $300 million in July compared to the prior month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.“More and more, the bond you have in the portfolio is something you want to protect,” Pate said.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

The U.S. Treasury yield curve has been inverted for over a year, with longer-term bonds yielding less than short-term debt instruments. This persistent situation pressures profits that banks can earn on loans."We would probably end up with an inverted yield curve for longer than anticipated, even if we don't end up with an economic recession," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research."That would end up curtailing lending because even if you were my brother-in-law, I wouldn't want to lend to you at a loss."The S&P 500 dropped 1.16% to end the session at 4,437.86 points.The S&P 500 closed below its 50-day moving average for the first time since March.The Nasdaq declined 1.14% to 13,631.05 points, while Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1.02% to 34,946.39 points.Volume on U.S. exchanges was relatively light, with 10.1 billion shares traded, compared to an average of 10.9 billion shares over the previous 20 sessions.Story continuesA report said ratings agency Fitch could downgrade multiple banks.

Text Content: (Reuters) - Private equity group TPG Capital has approached accounting giant Ernst & Young (EY) about buying a stake in its consulting arm, Financial Times reported on Tuesday, citing a letter it had reviewed.TPG outlined its plan for a debt-and-equity deal to separate the consulting arm from EY's audit business in a letter sent to the firm's global and U.S. bosses, the FT report added.TPG and EY did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for a comment.In September last year, EY announced its plans to split its audit and consulting units into two companies after regulators voiced concerns that the audit arm would not do its job fairly for its client if it also employed EY as a consultant.But the plan, code-named "Project Everest", faced resistance from some of EY's partners. The company said its U.S. executive committee decided not to move forward with the split, and in April this year called off the plan.Later that month, the U.S. arm of EY, one of the Big Four accounting giants, also said it was shedding 5% of its workforce, affecting around 3,000 of the company's U.S. employees.(Reporting by Manya Saini in Bengaluru; Editing by Shilpi Majumdar)

Text Content: By Laura Sanicola and Shariq Khan(Reuters) - U.S. motorists are squeezing out one last trip before Memorial Day holiday and school begins, as pump prices surge to their highest level this year on tighter gasoline supplies.Consumers tend to get a break from steeper fuel costs as peak vacation travel ebbs. But strong demand and a series of refinery outages have pushed the national average retail price to $3.86 per gallon on Tuesday, according to the American Automobile Association - 7% higher than a month ago. In California and Washington, prices have surged above $5 a gallon.National retail gasoline prices will average $3.90 a gallon this month, predict analysts at Goldman Sachs.Martin Jones, a vacationer from Massachusetts, filled up his Toyota Corolla during a sightseeing trip to Washington, D.C., on Tuesday. Jones said he was relieved prices were not close to the $5 a gallon level of last summer."Or I won't be able to make long drives like this as easily," Jones said.Retail prices in the U.S. Midwest jumped as much as 21 cents a gallon in Ohio and 16 cents in Michigan in the last week on earlier-than-expected maintenance at a BP refinery in Whiting, Indiana.Irving Oil's 320,000-barrel-per-day oil refinery in New Brunswick, Canada, and Delta's 185,000-barrel-per-day refinery in Trainer, Pennsylvania, will be down for much of September and part of October, affecting about 9% of the product supplied in their regions.BELOW-AVERAGE STOCKS"It is fairly abnormal to see prices going up" at this time of the year, said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at price tracker GasBuddy.com. "We tend to see prices declining going into the fall."Weekly U.S. gasoline stockpiles have remained below the five-year average of inventories throughout this year, setting the stage for price spikes if refining capacity is disrupted. Total U.S. gasoline stocks this month fell to 216.4 million barrels, the fifth decline in six weeks, according to U.S. government data.Story continuesAt the same time, record heat levels in Texas have likely led to a sharp 2% slump in U.S. refiners' product yields over the past few weeks, Goldman Sachs noted on Sunday. Small changes to the yield often add up to a meaningful decline in product availability, the bank added.Peak hurricane season is still ahead with the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) last week raising its outlook for storms due in part to record warm sea surface temperatures. Hurricanes can result in damage to or closures of U.S. oil refineries, particularly along the Gulf Coast.(Reporting by Laura Sanicola and Shariq Khan; editing by Stephanie Kelly and Aurora Ellis)

Text Content: NEW YORK (AP) — If you’re heading to college or starting to think about where you’d like to apply, you’re probably considering options for funding your education. If you need to borrow money to pursue your dreams, you are far from alone.According to the Federal Reserve, 30% of all U.S. adults said they incurred at least some debt for their education. Borrowers owe a collective $1.77 trillion in student loan debt, including federal and private loans.“Borrowing is almost at the point where it’s a requirement,” said Dana Kelly, from the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators.If you're a high school senior or a college student, you'll want to apply for federal student loans through the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, also known as FAFSA, in December for the 2024-2025 school year. For private student loans, you can apply whenever you need the loan.When you take out student loans, it's beneficial have to have an idea of what professional field you want to pursue, calculate how much you need to borrow, and understand the basics of loan interest. If this sound like a lot, don’t worry — we'll break it down for you. Here’s what you need to know.WHERE DO I START?The first step is to fill out the FAFSA. You will have to answer questions about your family’s financial contribution, along with other questions that will help determine if you qualify for federal or state financial aid and which loans you can apply for. You'll fill out the application each year.Cathy Mueller, executive director of Mapping Your Future, a non-profit that helps people navigate higher education, recommends exhausting every possible funding option to reduce the amount you need to borrow.If you’re looking to apply for scholarships to fund your college education, you can check out the College Board’s scholarship search directory.As you fill out the FAFSA, Mueller recommends that you estimate the amount you will need to borrow for your entire college career, but also be realistic about what you will be able to pay back.Story continuesA tool that can help is the Debt/Salary wizard from Mapping Your Future, an interactive calculator that helps determine how much you can borrow based on your estimated future earnings.WHAT ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT DATES TO KNOW?In previous years, the FAFSA opened on Oct. 1. This year, the government is making big changes and the application will be available in December, but the date has not yet been announced. The FAFSA application usually closes the following June.Once the application is open, you need to check your state's deadline to apply for state financial aid. Since financial aid is first-come, first-served, you'll want to apply as soon as you can to qualify for both federal and state grants.For private student loans, the timeline looks different. Private lenders require you to have proof of enrollment, so experts recommend you apply a couple of months before your tuition is due.WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FEDERAL STUDENT LOANS AND PRIVATE LOANS?Federal student loans are backed by the government and private loans come from banks, credit unions or other private institutions.In general, federal student loans offer lower interest rates and more opportunities for affordable repayment plans, such as the Public Service Forgiveness Plan or the various income-driven repayment plans.Kelly recommends that students try to only use federal student loans, though there are borrowing limits.“More than likely, private loans are going to cost a student more over the life of the loan,” Kelly said.Private loans come with a different set of requisites and application process.WHAT IF I RECEIVE MORE MONEY THAN I NEED?It's recommended that you calculate the amount that you will need to cover your education before you accept a student loan. You might get offered a bigger loan than you need. If this happens to you, Mueller recommends that you return the money you don't need, since it's a loan at the end of the day and you will have to pay back that amount with interest.If you find out that you'll want to return student loan money, contact your school's financial aid office to begin the process.WHAT ARE SUBSIDIZED AND UNSUBSIDIZED STUDENT LOANS?There are several different federal student loan options: direct subsidized loans, direct unsubsidized loans, direct PLUS loans and direct consolidation loans. But the most common are direct subsidized and unsubsidized loans, which are taken by the person who is completing the college degree.Subsidized loans have their interest covered by the government and are granted to students with demonstrated financial need. Subsidized loans have their interest covered while you're in school at least half-time, for six months after you graduate and if you qualify for deferment, which allows you to stop making payments temporarily. Unsubsidized loans are available to most students, but they are responsible for paying the interest.WHAT SHOULD I KNOW ABOUT STUDENT LOAN INTEREST RATES?Student loans must be paid back with interest, which is additional money that you pay for borrowing. The interest on your student loan depends on your type of loan and when your loan was made available for you to use for the first time.If your loan is disbursed on or after July 1, 2023, but before July 1, 2024, you will have a fixed interest rate of 5.5%.WHAT SHOULD I DO BEFORE I SIGN MY STUDENT LOAN AGREEMENT?Before you accept your student loan offer, regardless if it's federal or private, you want to make sure you understand the details, said Betsy Mayotte, president of The Institute of Student Loan Advisors. Those include when interest accrues, if interest is capitalized and if there are any late fees.If reading the details on your own feels daunting, Mayotte recommends speaking with a financial aid counselor, either at your university or elsewhere.If you meet with a counselor, it's good practice to come with prepared questions about repayment programs for when you need to start paying back your loan.Good questions to ask yourself or a counselor, according to Kelly, include:1. If I get this amount of a loan as a freshman, is that rate going to be flat over my four years? Or do you anticipate that I’m going to need to borrow more each year?2. Does my opportunity for scholarships go up so the amount I need to borrow can come down?If you are taking out federal student loans, it's a requirement that you complete an entrance counseling course. Kelly recommends that you pay extra attention to this process and not rush through it.WHAT IF I HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT MY STUDENT LOAN?If you have specific questions about your student loans, there are many resources available. You can visit the Federal Student Aid website or reach out to your college's financial aid office or community or non-profit organizations such as Mapping Your Future.WHAT ARE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS TO MANAGE MY STUDENT LOANS?Mueller recommends that you keep track of how much you are borrowing each year so you have an idea of how much you will owe by the end of your college career and how much your monthly payments will be.Mueller also recommends that, if you are working during college, you consider paying some of the interest that accumulates each year.“You’re not required to make those interest-only payments. But if you do, you’re saving yourself money in the long run,” Mueller said.Interest payments while you are still in college are generally low, but they get capitalized once you've graduated or left school, which means your loan gets larger and you would be paying interest on the interest, said Mueller.—The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- VinFast Auto Ltd. soared in its debut as a public company, vaulting its market capitalization beyond that of General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co., as traders flipped shares of the electric-vehicle maker.The Vietnamese company, which went public after a SPAC deal, is worth about $65 billion as shares held onto gains Tuesday, rising to $28.11 in New York — up nearly 190% from the SPAC’s IPO price and more than doubling the deal’s $23 billion implied equity value.Read more: Vietnam’s Richest Man Adds $30 Billion as EV Maker Goes PublicVinFast debuted on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol VFS to a flurry of trading and volatility halts after completing a merger with special-purpose acquisition company Black Spade Acquisition Co. The 170% surge from the closing price of the SPAC on Monday makes the company the top performing de-SPAC to debut this year on a US exchange.The eye-popping valuation makes VinFast worth more than GM, alone, and roughly the same as Ford and Rivian Automotive Inc. combined on paper in terms of market capitalization, just lagging BMW AG’s market value.However, it should be noted that VinFast is a low-float company. There’s a small amount of shares available for trading — just 1.3 million shares of the SPAC remain after redemptions — which means the stock’s move and value are prone to large swings.Regulatory filings show Pham Nhat Vuong, Vietnam’s wealthiest man and VinFast’s founder, controls about 99% of the entity, partly via shares held by his wife and Vingroup JSC. That means the vast majority of shares are locked up and unavailable to investors who would have gained from Tuesday’s rally.Story continuesRead more: SPACs With Small Floats Use Meme-Stock Playbook for Crazy SwingsAdditionally, companies that merge with black check firms tend to experience rallies that fizzle out a few trading sessions after a deal closes, when social media buzz subsides.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Asian stock markets are poised to open lower following declines across the board in the US as inflation and growth concerns sapped risk sentiment.Futures for equity benchmarks in Australia, Japan and Hong Kong all fell. The S&P 500, tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 and the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average ended just off session lows.A late-day selloff pushed the S&P 500 below its average price over the last 50 days for the first time since March, halting a streak of momentum that was by this measure the longest since September 2020.Stocks fell after retail sales came in above forecasts, bolstering the case for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates higher for longer. That message was reinforced by Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, who said that while inflation has been coming down, “it’s still too high.”Read: Fed Officials Shift Rates Debate From ‘How High’ to ‘How Long’Treasuries were mixed as investors pounced on elevated short-end rates. In the wake of the sales data, yields on two-year notes briefly spiked above 5%, a level it hasn’t closed above since early March, before reversing course. 10- and 30-year yields rose to the highest levels since October.Rhys Williams, chief strategist at Spouting Rock Asset Management, is skeptical that inflation can be brought down, and remain at, the central bank’s 2% target rate this year.“The most recent data — retail sales — shows the economy is still hanging in pretty well,” Williams said by phone. “Clearly the economy is better than anybody expected six months ago.”Financials weighed on the broader benchmark after a warning from Fitch Ratings that the firm may downgrade larger lenders like JPMorgan Chase & Co. or Bank of America Corp.Story continuesIn earnings, retailer Home Depot Inc. beat the average analyst estimate. More insight into the state of the consumer will come later this week when Target Corp. and Walmart Inc. are set to report.Elsewhere, China’s economic woes remained in focus, with US-listed shares of Chinese companies falling for a third day. JPMorgan lowered its full-year economic growth forecast for China to 4.8% from 5% after a raft of disappointing data for July. Separately, some analysts speculated China’s surprise rate cut on Tuesday may need further measures to revive confidence. Meanwhile, Macquarie Group lowered estimates for the yuan.While investors navigate a hawkish Fed and a slowdown in China, a devaluation in Argentina and Russia’s emergency rate hike on Tuesday to stem the ruble’s slide added to the risk-off sentiment.Still, Bank of America’s latest global survey of fund managers found investors the least pessimistic on stocks since February of last year, before the Fed began one of the most aggressive tightening cycles in decades.They increasingly expect no recession at all within the next 18 months, and a “soft landing” in the next 12 months remains the base case, BofA strategists led by Michael Hartnett wrote in a note.In Asia Wednesday, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand is likely to keep rates unchanged but send a hawkish signal to rein in elevated inflation expectations, according to Bloomberg Economics.On the economic front, the UK reports inflation and the Euro area posts growth figures.

Source: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/venezuela-rejects-auction-process-could-183455521.html
Text Content: By Marianna Parraga and Vivian SequeraHOUSTON/CARACAS, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Negotiators and officials representing Venezuela are opposing a court-ordered auction of shares in a parent of oil refiner Citgo Petroleum to pay creditors claiming more than $10 billion from expropriations and debt defaults.Some 20 creditors with arbitration awards or lawsuits against Venezuela and its state oil company PDVSA on Monday asked a federal court in Delaware to register their cases so they can participate in the October-scheduled auction. The auction puts priority on when claims were filed.Including interest and fees, the collective claims of companies including Crystallex International, ConocoPhillips , Tenaris SA and Exxon Mobil could exceed the market value of Citgo, the Venezuela-owned U.S. refiner, which has recently been put at between $10 billion and $13 billion.The boards that supervise Citgo since the company severed ties with its ultimate parent, Caracas-headquartered PDVSA, have unsuccessfully sought to negotiate payments with some of the larger creditors since last year."This is pointless, it is an unmanageable process," Horacio Medina, the head of the board that supervises Citgo, said of the court's decision to open the auction to all claimants. "What is the point ... To show that Venezuela owes $150 billion and cannot pay everyone? Why then to auction off an asset that would make it possible to negotiate additional payments?"The team representing Venezuela in the Delaware proceedings has been "very limited" in its effort negotiate payments, especially since the U.S. Treasury Department in March approved the court-organized auction.Spokespeople for Citgo and the Department of Justice did not immediately reply to requests for comment. The U.S. Treasury declined to comment.U.S. Senator Bob Menendez has said he will introduce a bill that would add Venezuela to the jurisdiction of the Department of Justice's Foreign Claims Settlement Commission. The move would ensure "an orderly process of adjudication for legal claims of U.S. nationals against the Venezuelan government," according to his office.Story continuesThat process could provide a fairer way to resolve the creditors' claims. But it could arrive too late for stopping the auction in Delaware, Medina said.Menendez's office did not immediately reply to a request for comment.Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, who has repeatedly criticized the upcoming auction, on Monday rejected the way Citgo is being managed, adding the company "has been kidnapped by the United States.""They are simply stealing a company that is worth $12 billion and that belongs to Venezuelans," he said late on Monday in a broadcast event.Venezuela's National Assembly in May formally rejected the U.S. Treasury's approval of the auction.(Reporting by Marianna Parraga in Houston and Vivian Sequera in Caracas Editing by Gary McWilliams and Matthew Lewis)

Source: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-bond-rating-downgrades-are-the-last-thing-banks-need-right-now-204145044.html
Text Content: Banks have a lot to worry about right now: high interest rates, rising deposit rates, slumping profitability.Now there is one more worry: bond rating downgrades.Banks rely heavily on the sale of bonds to help fund their operations, and ratings agencies are making it clear that those issuances could get more expensive due to a series of pressures making life more difficult for financial institutions across the country.The first warning on bond ratings came last week when Moody’s Investors Service last week downgraded 10 mid-sized institutions by a single notch, warned about a review of six additional lenders and assigned a negative outlook to 11 others.Then bank stocks dropped again on Tuesday after CNBC reported an alert from a Fitch Ratings analyst that the entire industry could be downgraded to A+ from AA-.A Fitch Ratings sign in New York City. (AP Photo/Henny Ray Abrams, File)Such a change from Fitch would put the industry's rating below some of the country's largest banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC), CNBC reported. Thus the credit ratings for those giant banks would need to be cut, which could trigger sweeping downward adjustments for many of their smaller rivals.The end result is that investors will demand more return to own bonds of banks with lower ratings, thereby increasing costs for banks and putting more pressure on profits."We expect sponsorship from debt investors to be there, albeit at a bigger price," Morgan Stanley analyst Manan Gosalia said in a research note last week. "The risk is that this downgrade wave is persistent and continues beyond" the third quarter, Gosalia added.Most bank stocks fell Tuesday. The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index (^BKX) fell 2.8% Tuesday while the KBW Nasdaq Regional Bank Index (^KRX) fell 3.4%.Among the country's biggest banks Bank of America (BAC) fell the most, 3.2%. M&T Bank (MTB) was down 4.2%. Western Alliance (WAL) and Comerica (CMA) fell 4% and 4.5%, respectively.New demands from regulatorsThe focus on the costs of selling bonds coincides with a campaign by regulators to pressure banks to issue more long-term debt as a way of stabilizing institutions during times of stress.Story continuesThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency are preparing a proposal that would require banks with at least $100 billion in assets to issue enough long-term debt to absorb losses if regulators were forced to seize the institution. The FDIC, Fed and OCC have already proposed that banks of this size hold more capital as a way of absorbing losses.The long-term debt requirement would make it easier for banks to hold onto depositors during periods of panic, according to FDIC chair Martin Gruenberg.Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation chairman Martin Gruenberg. (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)"Such a long-term debt requirement bolsters financial stability in several ways," Gruenberg said in a speech Monday. “It absorbs losses before the depositor class — the FDIC and uninsured depositors — take losses. This lowers the incentive for uninsured depositors to run."He said "we expect the proposal to provide for a reasonable timeline to meet the debt requirement and to take into account existing debt outstanding." The decision to apply it to banks with as little as $100 billion in assets was "an outcome certainly influenced by the events of earlier this year."This spring the failures of three sizable banks that were all within the range of $100-250 billion triggered outflows across the banking system and panic that other banks could also fall. Many mid-size banks were able to lure depositors back in the second quarter by paying more for them. That increase, however, is eating into a key measure of profitability.One bank trade group, the Bank Policy Institute, said the speech from Gruenberg didn’t include any discussion of the costs of imposing this new requirement at a time when "these banks are already facing significant deposit funding cost increases.""With this proposal, the government will be forcing a large supply of bank debt into the market, but it’s unclear whether there is going to be sufficient demand for it, meaning this proposal could end up doing more harm than good," said Tabitha Edgens, a BPI senior vice president and senior associate general counsel.Minneapolis Federal Reserve president Neel Kashkari. (Photo by John Lamparski/Getty Images)Minneapolis Federal Reserve resident Neel Kashkari said Tuesday that "banks have gotten through this reasonably well" but the risk is that if inflation is not completely under control the Fed may have to raise rates further and banks "might face more losses than they currently face today."He said he agrees with the proposal to require banks with at least $100 billion to hold more capital. "My own personal opinion is it doesn’t go far enough," he said. "I think it’s a step in the right direction, but I would like to go significantly further."Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance

Text Content: Wall Street got its first taste of Cava's (CAVA) future earnings potential.In its first quarterly report since its much-hyped IPO, the Mediterranean fast-casual restaurant chain turned profitable, with revenue jumping 62.4% year over year and same-store sales moving higher, up 18.2% in its Q2 earnings results.Cava stock (CAVA) popped more than 8% after the market close on Tuesday.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Profitability is a key focus.Last quarter, the company posted a net income of $6.5 million. In all of fiscal year 2021, the company posted a net loss of $37.4 million, which widened in 2022 to a net loss of $59 million."Revenue and profitability reached record levels," Cava co-founder and CEO Brett Schulman said in the earnings release. "Our dominant leadership position and proven portability create meaningful opportunity for growth in new and existing markets, as evidenced by our 16 Net New CAVA Restaurant Openings during the quarter."The earnings rundownFollowing its IPO, Cava stock closed at $43.30, valuing the restaurant chain at roughly $4.8 billion — almost twice what the company priced its valuation the night before at $22 per share (for a total valuation of $2.5 billion).The IPO was widely seen as a bellwether for other startups eyeing the public market.In mid-July, analysts initiated coverage on the stock with high hopes about its long-term potential and some drawing comparisons to rival Chipotle (CMG).In Q2, Cava saw same-store sales grow 18.2% year over year, topping Chipotle's 7.4% same-store sales growth in the second quarter. Sales were boosted by a 10% increase in guest traffic and higher menu prices and product mix, up 7.9%. In Q1 2023, Cava sales increased 28.4%.A banner for the Mediterranean restaurant chain Cava is displayed outside of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) as the company goes public on June 15, 2023, in New York City.

As of the end of Q2, there are now 279 Cava restaurants.The chain opened its first fast-casual concept back in 2011.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Vornado Realty Trust is exploring options for its redeveloped Farley Building, as it seeks to shore up liquidity during a commercial-property downturn.Vornado is exploring options including a partial or entire sale of the building, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified citing private information. The company could also put a mortgage on the asset, which currently has no debt on it, the people said.The REIT, led by billionaire Steven Roth, has tapped Newmark Group Inc.’s co-heads of US capital markets, Adam Spies and Douglas Harmon, to handle the process, the people familiar with the matter said. Discussions are still preliminary and it’s unclear exactly what path Vornado will pursue.The former Post Office building, located across from New York’s Pennsylvania Station, is leased to tech giant Meta Platforms Inc. The company signed the deal for 730,000 square feet (67,800 square meters) in the depths of the pandemic in 2020, with a 15-year term. Green Street’s Real Estate Alert first reported that Vornado was exploring its options for the building.A spokesperson for Newmark declined to comment. Vornado didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.Read More: Facebook Pushes Ahead With NYC Farley Project in Bet on Offices“It’s arguably one of the best buildings of its type and kind in the city,” Roth, Vornado’s chief executive officer, said during an earnings call earlier this month. He added that the Farley Building “could be an important source of liquidity.”Vornado and other property owners have been hit by soaring borrowing costs and falling values over the past year. The Manhattan-based company has been active in selling assets in a bid to boost liquidity. Earlier this year, the firm announced deals to offload four retail properties in Manhattan and the Armory Show.Story continuesVornado has sought to redevelop more than 5 million square feet of real estate near Penn Station. But the plans are in turmoil given the uncertainty in the commercial real estate market.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Wheat dropped for a third day to the lowest level since early June as grain exports continued from Russia and Ukraine even as tensions remain in the Black Sea region.Benchmark futures in Chicago traded as much as 3.1% lower after sliding 1.9% on Monday. Russia opened fire on a ship over the weekend to force the vessel to stop for checks, a continuation of hostilities in the key trade route after Ukrainian drones attacked Russian vessels earlier this month.The US Department of Agriculture raised its estimate for shipments from Russia on Friday and lifted its estimate for US wheat stocks at the close of the 2023-24 season by more than analysts had expected on average.The fact that exports have continued is one of the key reasons for the decline in prices, according to CRM Agricommodities. “Focus returned to Friday’s Wasde report, which was broadly viewed as somewhat bearish,” the consultant said in a a report.Wheat has about 20% this year due to bumper harvests.Prices were pressured on Tuesday by good crop conditions in spring wheat, robust harvest pace for US winter wheat and the overseas sentiment, said Jacqueline Holland, an analyst at Farm FuturesPlentiful Russian exports are “keeping global buyers well-stocked for the time being,” she said.The USDA raised its estimate for Russian wheat exports to 48 million metric tons for the 2023-24 season. That means almost a quarter of the world’s trade will now come from Russia.--With assistance from Áine Quinn.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Cava Group Inc. expects higher profits this year, although it cautioned that a muddy consumer-spending picture could limit sales gains.In its first annual outlook after going public in June, the fast-casual Mediterranean chain projected restaurant-level profit margins of at least 23%, which is three percentage points higher than in 2022. Same-restaurant sales growth, a measure of how stores open for at least a year are performing, are seen 13% to 15% higher. At the low end, that figure implies a slight deceleration from last year’s 14.2% advance.For now, Cava is maintaining its allure, with same-store sales in the three months through July 19 powered by higher diner traffic — in contrast with some peers. Still, Chief Executive Officer Brett Schulman is keeping an eye on how the restart of student loan payments, higher utility bills and elevated interest rates are affecting consumer spending.“We’ve been very pleased with the momentum in the business,” Schulman said in an interview. “But like many others, we’re mindful of the potential macroeconomic headwinds on the horizon.”Cava’s Mediterranean dishes, which include crispy falafel pitas and lemon chicken bowls, are resonating as the chain expands into states such as Missouri and Rhode Island, Schulman said. It opened 16 new locations in the second quarter. The company’s diners ordered more premium dishes in the period, bolstering sales, he said, adding that prices have risen less than 4% from the prior year.Traffic has remained positive into the third quarter but has moderated slightly, Schulman said. Some customers are also opting for pickup over delivery, mirroring industry trends.Story continuesCava revenue was $172.9 million in the quarter through July 9, up 27% from the prior year. Net income per share was 21 cents in the period, compared with a loss of $6.23 a year earlier.The shares have risen 111% from its June 14 IPO through Tuesday’s close. The S&P 500 Index restaurants index has advanced 3.5% in that period.The company expects to open a total of 65 to 70 new locations this year.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- President Xi Jinping has resisted pulling the trigger on a major stimulus to revive the world’s second-biggest economy. The grim market reaction to a surprise rate cut shows investors want to see him take much bolder steps.The People’s Bank of China on Tuesday lowered the rate on its one-year loans — or medium-term lending facility — by 15 basis points to 2.5%, the steepest cut in three years. The move came shortly before the release of July data that showed weak consumer spending growth, sliding investment and rising unemployment.Zooming out, the economic picture looks even worse. Bank loans plunged to a 14-year low last month, while deflation is setting in and exports are contracting. One of China’s largest property developers is at risk of default and a financial conglomerate with 1 trillion yuan ($138 billion) under management missed payments on investment products, stoking fears about possible contagion.All of that is adding pressure on Xi to do more in two areas he has sought to avoid: Helping out the heavily indebted property sector and giving consumers more cash to spend — something an adviser to the People’s Bank of China this week called “the most urgent goal.”The failure to revive confidence more broadly risks leading to economic pain that could blow back on Communist Party leaders. Last year saw a wave of mortgage boycotts and unprecedented protests against Xi himself as residents got fed up with the world’s strictest Covid-19 restrictions.Chinese authorities remain sensitive about the narrative over the economy, instructing analysts to avoid discussing deflation and restricting access to key data. China on Tuesday suspended publishing data on its soaring youth unemployment rate to iron out complexities in the numbers, fanning fears about transparency.Story continues“The declining economy dramatically increases the risk of unrest,” said Drew Thompson, a former Pentagon official and businessman in China who is now a senior fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore. “The Communist Party should be circling the wagons.”The struggles facing China are also bad news for the world. Stocks and bonds declined as concern grew that the global economy will suffer without a sustained recovery in China, which the International Monetary Fund has previously projected would be the top contributor to global growth through 2028.US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen this week said China’s slowdown was a “risk factor” for the American economy. Weaker imports of major commodities also threatens producers from Australia to Brazil, while softer demand for electronics will impact trade-dependent economies like South Korea and Taiwan.The CSI 300 Index, a benchmark of onshore China stocks, ended 0.2% lower even after Bloomberg reported that Chinese authorities may cut the stamp duty on stock trades for the first time since 2008 — news that helped boost sentiment after the rate cut and weak Chinese data failed to impress investors.While some economists were more encouraged by the central bank’s actions than others, all seemed to agree on one thing: Authorities have more work to do on both the monetary and fiscal side.“The PBOC rate cuts today set the stage for looser liquidity conditions that could eventually support an even bigger fiscal push,” said Louise Loo, lead economist at Oxford Economics Ltd. “So that is encouraging.”Economists at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., including Xing Zhaopeng and Raymond Yeung, said the rate on the PBOC’s one-year policy loans may need to be reduced to 1.2% — a terminal rate implying additional cuts of 130 basis points. Rate cuts, they said, will “smooth the shocks and buy time for structural reforms” such as upgrading industry, greater urbanization and more deleveraging.“China’s slowdown is more structural than cyclical,” they said.Welfare TrapStill, some economists have said the government’s strategy so far is doing little to move the needle, especially as the property crisis worsens.“The PBOC wants to get the banks to lend, but it seems it’s not been successful as both loan demand from households and credit-worthy corporations have been weak,” said Redmond Wong, market strategist at Saxo Capital Markets. He said that’s because banks have been reluctant to lend to property firms and other private companies, given the uncertainty surrounding the ability of those businesses to pay back their debts.Country Garden Holdings Co. — once China’s largest developer by sales — now faces potential default despite being a recipient of government-led support for the sector. Fears that problems at Country Garden and other developers are spilling over elsewhere have been exacerbated by reports of payment problems linked to Zhongzhi Enterprise Group Co., a multi-billion-dollar shadow banking firm.What Bloomberg Economics Says ...“China’s activity data show the economy skidding into the second half of the year — clear reason for the swift and unusually large rate cut Tuesday. The readings on production, investment and consumption all undershot expectations, showing June’s rate cut didn’t move the dial.”— David Qu and Chang Shu, economistsFor the full report, click here.“The latest financial problems with one of the country’s largest developers throws cold water on recent policy measures aimed to revive a troubled sector,” said David Chao, global market strategist for Asia Pacific ex-Japan at Invesco Ltd.The government’s inability to stem the property downturn or boost confidence among businesses and households has led some to argue for more dramatic measures. Cai Fang, a central bank adviser, this week said it is “necessary to use all reasonable, legally compliant and economic channels to put money in residents’ pockets.”Cutting checks for consumers, though, has long been viewed as a non-starter within a government that has repeatedly warned against the trap of “welfarism.”Andrew Batson, China research director for Gavekal Dragonomics, wrote in a note earlier this month that Chinese policymakers were likely reluctant to use direct transfers to households as a short-term stimulus due to fears of “setting a fiscally destabilizing precedent.”“The next time China falls short of potential growth and full employment, the political pressure to roll out household transfers again would be overwhelming,” Batson wrote. “What started as a one-off policy response could become entrenched as the expected response to any growth slowdown, and would add to government deficits and debt over many years rather than just one.”With no elections to worry about, and more power than any leader since Communist Party founder Mao Zedong, Xi is betting that he can ride out the downturn.--With assistance from Rebecca Choong Wilkins, Ishika Mookerjee, Yujing Liu and James Mayger.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Inflation ticked back above the Bank of Canada’s control range in July, but progress on underlying price pressures leaves room for policymakers to pause interest-rate hikes.The consumer price index rose 3.3% from a year ago, the first reacceleration since April, Statistics Canada reported Tuesday in Ottawa. That was faster than the 3% forecast by economists in a Bloomberg survey. On a monthly basis, the index rose 0.6%, double their expectations.Canada’s headline rate is now above that in the US for the first time in three years. But the uptick is watered down by some easing in core measures. Two key yearly metrics tracked closely by the Canadian central bank — the so-called trim and median core rates, which filter out extreme price fluctuations — eased, averaging 3.65% from a downwardly revised 3.7% a month earlier.“The modest slowing in core CPI is a bit of a silver lining for policymakers in a generally strong CPI report,” Benjamin Reitzes, a rates and macro strategist at Bank of Montreal, said by email. The Bank of Canada “likely wants to move to the sidelines in September and give prior hikes time to have an impact, but the inflation figures aren’t making that an easy call.”A three-month moving average of the measures that Governor Tiff Macklem says is key to his team’s thinking fell to an annualized pace of 3.49%, from an upwardly revised 3.91% previously, according to Bloomberg calculations. That’s the slowest rate of increase since October 2022.The loonie umped after the release of the data, before paring those gains to trade at C$1.3476 per US dollar at 11:41 a.m. Ottawa time. Canadian bonds slipped, with the yield on two-year debt up 4 basis points on the day to 4.767%.Story continuesTuesday’s numbers highlight a challenge in the current phase of the inflation fight after favorable base effects — which lent a helping hand to the deceleration in recent months — ran their course. July’s rise was partly due to gasoline prices, which fell sharply in July 2022 and so didn’t have the same downward impact on the 12-month headline figure as in June.Macklem and his officials expect consumer price gains to remain near 3% for the next year, saying last month that the next stage in the decline toward the 2% target is “expected to take longer and is more uncertain.”The latest inflation print with cooling core measures — along with recent signs of softening in the economy and labor market — may pave the way for policymakers to return to pause mode as early as their next meeting on Sept. 6. The majority of economists expect the central bank to hold the overnight rate steady at 5% next month.“Domestic demand in Canada’s economy continues to hum along, and as a result we expect progress on inflation to remain disappointing through the remainder of the year,” Leslie Preston, senior economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank, said in a report to investors. “This is pushing up expectations that the BoC may pursue another rate hike in the fall months as it gathers more information on the jobs market and overall inflation.”Tuesday’s release is the last of two inflation reports before the September decision.The continued above-target gains in the core measures “will cause some concern for the Bank of Canada and means it is still too early to rule out a further interest rate hike altogether,” Olivia Cross, an economist at Capital Economics, said in a report to investors. “Nonetheless, we still expect a more pronounced easing of core inflation later this year.”Services inflation rose to 4.3% in July from 4.2% one month earlier.On a year-over-year basis, prices for gasoline fell 12.9% in July after a 21.6% decline in June, while on a monthly basis, prices remained nearly unchanged at 0.9%.The mortgage interest cost index posted another record year-over-year gain and remained the largest contributor to the headline rate. Excluding mortgage costs, the rate rose 2.4%.Grocery prices grew at a slower pace year over year, rising 8.5% last month after a 9.1% increase in June.On a monthly basis, higher prices for travel tours and air transportation led the gain, jumping 15.5% and 13.6% respectively, with July being a peak travel month.Regionally, prices rose at a faster pace in July compared with June in all provinces except British Columbia and Saskatchewan. Price growth accelerated the most in Prince Edward Island, largely due to a rise in energy prices.Electricity prices rose 127.8% in July from a year ago in Alberta amid high summer demand and followed the phasing out of provincial rebates and a price cap.In Nova Scotia, consumers saw gasoline prices jump 14% from a month earlier, the fastest pace in the country, primarily due to the introduction of the carbon levy and higher wholesale prices.--With assistance from Erik Hertzberg.(Updates with new size and scope on 3-month moving average of core measures.)©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: By Siddharth CavaleNEW YORK (Reuters) - Walmart is set to raise its full-year earnings forecast on Thursday when it reports quarterly results, as U.S. shoppers continue to buy essentials even as borrowing costs rise, lending standards tighten and the employment picture weakens.The world's largest retailer, as measured by sales, will offer a glimpse into demand for back-to-school products.A monthly survey conducted by brokerage Stifel in August showed that more people intend to shop at Walmart compared to Costco and Target, even as they planned to spend 16% less on back-to-school purchases this year compared to a year ago."We find the anticipated lower spending notable and a watch-point, as it suggests continued weakness in general merchandise categories," Stifel analyst Mark Astrachan said.Walmart is in a sweet spot among retailers as broader economic stresses push more people to shop for essentials such as groceries, its core business. Selling toilet paper, beans, pasta and toothpaste brings people into its stores, giving Walmart opportunities to cross sell more profitable merchandise including pens, notepads and backpacks.With more and more shoppers visiting Walmart's Supercenters, Neighborhood Markets and its online website for their daily needs, the retailer issued upbeat second-quarter forecasts and raised profit and sales estimates for its fiscal year ending Jan. 31, 2024.Rival Target, which reports results on Wednesday, in contrast expects a dour second-quarter and a drop in sales for its fiscal year. Target has a smaller grocery business than Walmart's and has focused on selling clothes, electronics and beauty products to inflation-squeezed Americans.Many are instead spending more on dining out, hobbies and sporting equipment, as demonstrated by the latest U.S. retail sales data on Tuesday.Home Depot on Tuesday reiterated its muted forecast for the year after it said it saw continued caution on the part of consumers towards big ticket items and discretionary categories.Story continuesWalmart, which is known for its low prices, drew in shoppers earning more than $100,000 a year during peak inflation in 2022.Walmart CEO Doug McMillon in May cautioned that stubborn inflation, especially in food, was "one of the key factors creating uncertainty for us in the back half of the year."Since then, food inflation has eased, however. And in July, Walmart announced that it would sell 14 of the most popular items on school supply lists, including Pen + Gear Composition notebooks and 24-count Crayola Crayons, at the same prices as last year."As a retail bellwether Walmart's comments on back to school trends will be a market mover as well as a preview of potential holiday trends," D.A. Davidson analyst Michael Baker said, adding that back-to-school trends have led the direction of holiday sales in 23 of the last 29 years.UBS, Credit Suisse, Telsey Advisory Group and CFRA Research are among brokerages that expect Walmart to raise its full-year forecast for the second time this year.Walmart in May forecast net sales would rise about 3.5% this fiscal year, up from its prior outlook in February of a 2.5% to 3% rise, in part due to higher prices. It also raised its earnings forecast.Capital Wealth Planning, a Walmart investor, owns $258 million in Walmart shares after raising its stake in the company in June.The firm's founder Kevin Simpson said he is hesitant to buy more stock unless the retailer can show it is able to expand margins without solely relying on inflation-driven price hikes.Walmart trades at 24.2 times 12-month forward earnings compared to 14.9 times for Target and 19.9 times for the S&P 500 Consumer Staples index, according to Refinitiv DataStream. Simpson characterized Walmart's current multiple as "high.""I need to see earnings increasing more than anything else because that's the only thing that can justify a higher stock price over time," Simpson told Reuters.(Reporting by Siddharth Cavale in New York; Editing by Vanessa O'Connell and Deepa Babington)

Text Content: By Joey RouletteWASHINGTON, Aug 15 (Reuters) - U.S. space startups have slashed workforces and restructured operations to survive amid an investment drought that has grounded once-lofty aspirations. While more established players like Elon Musk's SpaceX and Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin spend billions on new, bigger rockets, rocket startup Astra Space, satellite imagery firm Planet Labs and privately held engine maker Ursa Major recently laid off workers to cut costs.Those struggles follow the April bankruptcy filing by satellite launch firm Virgin Orbit, which was owned by billionaire Richard Branson. Among the factors cited by the company were volatile capital markets and Branson's reluctance to invest further."The focus for investors in this space is very different than what it was a couple years ago. It's less about your potential," Ursa Major CEO Joe Laurienti told Reuters. "It's more about how can you build a healthy pipeline ... and execute and deliver upon the efforts that you promised."While a steep drop in space investments spurred by a grim economic outlook in the past year appeared to stabilize in the most recent quarter, startups, many of which went public through blank-check companies to raise cash, are reeling from the downturn's impact.Quilty Analytics analyst Caleb Henry called it a tough capital market and said startups are working with what they have rather than banking on an influx of new funds."We're seeing a bit of a decrease in investor risk appetite, and that is made worse in some cases by poor company performance, and then more broadly, things like high interest rates and general market uncertainty," he added.Astra disclosed last week it laid off a quarter of its workforce and diverted focus from its rocket launch program, once the core of its business. It is now focusing on its satellite propulsion unit, a more immediate source of revenue that it split off as a separate entity earlier this year.Story continues"The spacecraft engine business is a much different business than launch," Astra CEO Chris Kemp told Reuters. "Having it all mixed up with launch was making it harder for us to raise capital"The company, which is delaying tests of its rocket to 2024 to focus on the satellite engine unit, reported on Monday it had $26 million in cash and securities on hand. That was down from $201 million the prior year.STEEP CHALLENGESWith complex technologies and explosion-riddled tests that often spook investors, venture-backed and publicly traded rocket businesses have faced some of the steepest financial challenges. The industry also includes satellite imagery and analytics firms, seen as safer bets by investors due to more predictable demand.But even those satellite firms have struggled.Planet Labs, which went public in 2021, shed 10% of its roughly 1,000 employees earlier this month, citing the tough economy and the company's overly fast expansion."Our business has scaled rapidly and continues to grow apace, but the expansion of projects has also increased cost and complexity, which slowed us down in some regards," CEO Will Marshall told employees in an Aug. 1 note posted on the company's website.Quilty's Henry said Planet Labs hired too aggressively. "That's not an uncommon mistake for startups to make, especially once they become flush with cash."The financial headwinds faced by rocket startups have triggered pain elsewhere as well.Denver-based Ursa Major, whose engines are designed for rockets and hypersonic crafts, laid off 27% of its workforce this summer. It shifted much of its focus to government defense programs as its commercial customers face tight capital markets, CEO Laurienti said."The hope is that shift really generated some confidence," he added, "and started to show that we're acknowledging this isn't times of zero percent interest rates and venture capital flowing like crazy."

Source: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hp-fails-derail-claims-bricks-161257809.html
Text Content: SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — HP has failed to shunt aside class-action legal claims that it disables the scanners on its multifunction printers when their ink runs low. Though not for lack of trying.On Aug. 10, a federal judge ruled that HP Inc. must face a class-action lawsuit claiming that the company designs its “all-in-one” inkjet printers to disable scanning and faxing functions whenever a single printer ink cartridge runs low. The company had sought — for the second time — to dismiss the lawsuit on technical legal grounds.“It is well-documented that ink is not required in order to scan or to fax a document, and it is certainly possible to manufacture an all-in-one printer that scans or faxes when the device is out of ink,” the plaintiffs wrote in their complaint. “Indeed, HP designs its all-in-one printer products so they will not work without ink. Yet HP does not disclose this fact to consumers.”The lawsuit charges that HP deliberately withholds this information from consumers to boost profits from the sale of expensive ink cartridges.Color printers require four ink cartridges -- one black and a set of three cartridges in cyan, magenta and yellow for producing colors. Some will also refuse to print if one of the color cartridges is low, even in black-and-white mode.HP declined to comment on the issue, citing the pending litigation. The company’s court filings in the case have generally not addressed the substance of the plaintiff’s allegations.In early 2022, U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman dismissed the complaint on legal grounds but did not address the lawsuit's claims. The judge allowed the plaintiffs to amend their claim and resubmit it. On Aug. 10, the judge largely rejected HP's request to dismiss the revised complaint, allowing the case to proceed.All-in-one inkjet printers generally seem like a bargain compared to the cost of separate devices with scanning, copying and fax functions. For instance, HP currently sells its all-in-one OfficeJet Pro 8034e online for just $159. But its least expensive standalone scanner, the ScanJet Pro s2, lists for $369 — more than twice the cost of the multifunction printer.Story continuesOf course, only one of these devices requires printer ink. “Printer ink is wildly expensive,” Consumer Reports states in its current printer buying guide, noting that consumer ink costs can easily run more than $70 a year.Worse, a significant amount of printer ink is never actually used to print documents because it's consumed by inkjet printer maintenance cycles. In 2018, Consumer Reports tested of hundreds of all in one inkjet printers and found that with intermittent printer use, many models delivered less than half of their ink to printed documents. A few managed no more than 20% to 30%.HP isn't alone in facing such legal complaints. A different set of plaintiffs sued the U.S. unit of printer and camera maker Canon Inc. in 2021 for similarly handicapping its all-in-one printers without disclosure. The parties settled that case in late 2022.

Text Content: Aug 15 (Reuters) - Union members are planning to vote on a strike at Detroit Three automakers next week, the United Auto Workers (UAW) said on Tuesday, as it pushes the companies to reach new contract terms by Sept. 14 deadline.The UAW's warning comes as the two sides have made little headway with their negotiations. U.S. President Joe Biden has already called on the automakers and union members to reach a new agreement before the contracts expire next month."Whether or not there's a strike next month is entirely up to the Big Three automakers," UAW president Shawn Fain said in a statement.Fain will address the pace of negotiations and announce preparations for strike authorization votes to be held next week by 150,000 UAW members at Ford, General Motors and Stellantis on Facebook Live later in the day, the union said.The announcement comes after workers at aerospace supplier Spirit AeroSystems rejected a contract that their leaders negotiated with their employer, joining freight railroad employees, airline pilots and others who are growing more fed up with stagnant pay, high healthcare costs, scanty sick time and uncertain scheduling.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Norway’s $1.4 trillion sovereign wealth fund returned 10%, or $143 billion, in the first half, indicating it’s back on track following one of the worst years in its history.The manager of Norway’s oil and gas riches gained just under 14% on equities in the six months through June, while fixed-income investments returned 2.3%, according to the report posted on its website late on Tuesday. Unlisted real estate holdings were down 4.6%. The fund’s report was set to be released Wednesday.In the first part of the year, fast inflation and central bank campaigns to tame price increases coincided with banking industry tumult in the US and Europe, and the Oslo-based fund managed to navigate the wobbly investment environment.Still, the fund took a hit on the collapse of SVB Financial Group’s Silicon Valley Bank earlier this year, prompting Chief Executive Officer Nicolai Tangen to tell lawmakers in April that he was focused on minimizing exposure to so-called rotten apples going forward. He’s also repeatedly warned that borrowing costs and soaring inflation are likely to weigh on returns in the years to come.Created in the 1990s to invest Norway’s oil and gas revenues abroad, the fund - also known as Norges Bank Investment Management - is the world’s biggest single owner of equities, largely tracking a benchmark index based on a framework handed down by parliament.It is increasingly using its muscle to take a stronger stance against companies that fail to prioritize action on climate change, gender balance and executive pay. It now performs quarterly sustainability assessments and will require the companies it invests in to reach net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest.Story continues©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: (Adds estimate, context in paragraphs 2-4)BRASILIA, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Brazil will likely need to upwardly revise its inflation estimates, central bank Governor Roberto Campos Neto said on Tuesday after state-run oil giant Petrobras announced a fuel price hike earlier in the day.According to Campos Neto, who was speaking at an event hosted by lawmakers, the move's impact on inflation is expected to amount to around 0.4 percentage points between August and September.Petrobras said it will raise average gasoline prices by 16.3% to 2.93 reais ($0.5893) per liter beginning Wednesday, while diesel prices will be increased by 25.8% to 3.80 reais per liter.The central bank chief stressed that while the result of higher diesel prices was indirect, more expensive gasoline reflects directly on the benchmark IPCA inflation index.On the other hand, he added that services inflation - which the central bank has been closely monitoring - has started to fall, "and it's important that it does."The bank embarked on an easing cycle earlier this month by cutting its benchmark interest rate to 13.25% after holding it steady for nearly a year to battle inflation.In its policy statement, the central bank estimated inflation at 4.9% this year and 3.4% in 2024, in both cases above the official targets of 3.25% and 3%, respectively.(Reporting by Marcela Ayres; Editing by Aurora Ellis)

Text Content: By Jamie McGeeverAug 16 (Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in Asian markets from Jamie McGeever, financial markets columnist.The word 'crisis' should always be used responsibly and judiciously when covering financial markets, business and economics, but are we at that point now with China? Developments in the last 24 hours from the world's second largest economy - another string of top-tier data 'misses', a shock interest rate cut and an abrupt announcement that (record high) youth unemployment data will no longer be published - suggest we might be. The deepening concern around China's economy, policy options and financial markets will weigh heavily on Asian investor sentiment on Wednesday, with an interest rate decision from New Zealand and the latest manufacturing and service sector 'tankan' surveys from Japan also on tap. It's not all doom and gloom in Asia - Japan's economy grew twice as fast in the second quarter as economists had expected - but China's travails are front and center right now.Perhaps even more worrying for investors than the misses on investment, industrial production and retail sales, or the surprise rate cut, was Beijing's decision to suspend the publication of youth unemployment figures for an unspecified length of time. The official rate in June was a record 21.3%. That's bad enough, but in an online post last month - since removed - Peking University professor Zhang Dandan estimated it could be closer to 50%.The latest snapshot of Chinese house prices will be released on Wednesday, and again, another weak report could be in store, with the country's property sector in a genuine state of crisis.JP Morgan on Tuesday said if developer Country Garden suffers a full-scale default, it will more than double China's year-to-date property default tally to $17 billion, adding to the $100 billion racked up over the past two and a half years.The People's Bank of China may have finally pulled the interest rate lever, but it had the expected impact of slamming the exchange rate. The offshore yuan tumbled through 7.30 per dollar to its weakest level this year and is now flirting with November's historic low of around 7.35 per dollar.Story continuesCompare and contrast China with Japan, as per Tuesday's bumper Q2 GDP data, and the U.S., where figures on Tuesday showed a surge in retail sales. The Atlanta Fed's GDPNow model is projecting annualized Q3 growth of 5.0%. Global stocks, Wall Street and emerging markets all buckled on Tuesday under the weight of rising bond yields, 'higher for longer' Fed rate expectations and a buoyant dollar.The MSCI Asia ex-Japan index fell for a fourth day and has now only risen twice in the last 11 sessions. Among the biggest losers in Asia on Tuesday was Hong Kong's mainland property index, which fell 1% to take its year-to-date decline to 16%.Here are key developments that could provide more direction to markets on Wednesday:- New Zealand interest rate decision- China house prices (July)- Japan tankan surveys (August)(By Jamie McGeever; Editing by Josie Kao)

Source: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ecuador-presidential-hopeful-zurita-promises-192649290.html
Text Content: By Alexandra ValenciaQUITO, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Ecuador presidential hopeful Christian Zurita, who is running in place of his friend, slain candidate Fernando Villavicencio, said on Tuesday he would better equip the police and enshrine intelligence protocols to fight crime, and use international loans to shore up social programs.Villavicencio was gunned down last week as he left a campaign event. His assassination left many voters weighing whether to participate in the Sunday ballot, as it drew attention to the sharp deterioration of security in Ecuador.Like his predecessor, Zurita is an investigative journalist known for tracking alleged corruption.The two men worked on 300 investigations together over the last decade, Zurita, 53, told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday."Until last Saturday I was a journalist," he said, adding Villavicencio would never have forgiven him if he allowed the campaign to die. "We do it for Fernando, we do it so his voice is not silenced."Villavicencio's death must be thoroughly investigated, Zurita added, and given how much corruption Villavicencio exposed, the suspect list is long."They already killed Fernando. There's no need anymore for threats. If they killed him we know they are coming for us," said Zurita, who added he is unafraid. "The only way is to confront it."The police must have the technology they need to properly combat crime, Zurita said, as well as a robust and well-regulated intelligence protocol for the security services."How do you fight something so big and powerful? There must be a series of consideration which first counts social issues. And second, puts the police in order."Efforts could be funded by loans from other countries, Zurita said, and taxes should be reduced on businesses that hire young people."If there is no social investment and no work, (insecurity) will grow," Zurita said.A new wave of migration stoked by unemployment has put the struggling economy at the forefront of concern for many voters.Story continuesThe government must ensure small businesses can operate without fear of extortion and workers can choose how many hours they want to work, Zurita said, before it thinks about steps to attract foreign investment.There will not be time during the truncated presidential period, which will last only until May 2025, for a new oil round or other major foreign investment efforts, he added."What we can think about are re-negotiations of (oil) contracts with existing companies," Zurita said.The report Villavicencio made to the attorney general's office the day before his death was about a contract between state-run oil Petroecuador and top oilfield services firm SLB, formerly known as Schlumberger, Zurita said.The production cost per barrel outlined in the contract favors the French company and is detrimental to Petroecuador, he said. SLB did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Another party is contesting his candidacy, Zurita said, a roadblock that could prevent electoral authorities from approving him until Sunday, the day of the vote.That blocks his chance of advertising, though the electoral council has said all votes for Villavicencio, who will appear on already-printed ballots, will be counted for his replacement."If they don't approve (the candidacy) it all will have been in vain," Zurita said.The national electoral council said it had not yet received an objection to the candidacy.Zurita has historically clashed with former President Rafael Correa, whose candidate Luisa Gonzalez has led polling.Correa sued Zurita for moral injury over a book about his brother's business dealings and won a settlement, but later forgave the journalist. Zurita never paid the indemnity. (Reporting by Alexandra Valencia in Quito, additional reporting by Gary McWilliams in Houston Writing by Julia Symmes Cobb; Editing by David Gregorio)

Text Content: (Recasts throughout with comments from conference call, adds details on weight-loss drugs in paragraphs 2,3)By Mariam SunnyAug 15 (Reuters) - Drug distributor Cardinal Health Inc on Tuesday raised fiscal 2024 expectations for sales at its pharmaceutical unit, banking on growing demand for newer weight-loss drugs, including GLP-1 treatments.GLP-1s, which have seen overwhelming demand in the United States, are a class of drugs that help regulate blood sugar, slow the rate at which the stomach empties of food and decrease appetite by mimicking a gut hormone.The drugs include Novo Nordisk's semaglutide, sold under brand name Wegovy for obesity and Ozempic for diabetes, as well as Eli Lilly's diabetes treatment Mounjaro, which is being prescribed for obesity even though it's not approved for it.Cardinal peers AmerisourceBergen and McKesson have also flagged a potential boost to revenues for drug distributors due to high demand for these drugs."Looking forward, we see that there's nothing that we can foresee in the near term that will change those trends," Cardinal CFO Aaron Alt said on a conference call, referring to demand for GLP-1 drugs.It now expects revenue from its pharmaceuticals unit to rise 10% to 12% in fiscal 2024, compared with its previous expectation of about 10% growth.However, the company added the trend would not add to its profit. It raised its 2024 profit forecast slightly to a range of $6.50 to $6.75 per share, from $6.45 to $6.70 it had forecast previously.Analysts on average were expecting a profit of $6.59 per share, according to Refinitiv.Excluding one-off items, Cardinal Health reported a profit of $1.55 per share in the fourth quarter ended June 30, topping expectations of $1.49 per share.Quarterly sales stood at $53.45 billion, $730 million above analysts' average estimate.

Text Content: (Adds graphics, quotes in paragraphs 6 and 12, context and analyst comment in paragraph 10)By Jorge OtaolaBUENOS AIRES, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Argentina's monthly inflation rate came in at 6.3% in July, the country's statistics agency said on Tuesday, well below forecasts of a 7.1% jump, though analysts said it was expected to heat up again in August amid market turbulence.The South American nation is battling its worst inflation since the early 1990s, with annual price rises at 113.4% through July, slightly down versus a month earlier. The rise in costs saps wages and savings and has left four-in-10 people under the poverty line.The rapid price rises, which see retail and input costs constantly hiked, is playing a key role in the presidential election race ahead of an Oct. 22 general vote, with a far-right libertarian candidate riding a wave of voter anger."It's unsustainable. I really don't know how this is going to continue from here to October or in the future," said Alberto Acosta, a 47-year-old salesman, saying the price of his truck insurance had been hiked 35% to 26,000 pesos ($74.30)."As a laborer, traveling every day it's bad, you can't make ends meet," he said.Annual inflation is seen hitting 142% by the end of the year, the latest central bank analyst poll estimates, but could rise further after a near 20% devaluation of the peso currency on Monday amid a market sell-off, which eased on Tuesday.In a bid to ease the economic crisis, the country's central bank hiked the benchmark interest rate to 118% on Monday and let the peso currency, held in check by capital controls, slide sharply to a fixed 350 per dollar until the October vote.That is being contested in a three-way race between outsider libertarian Javier Milei, who won the largest vote share in a Sunday primary, conservative Patricia Bullrich and economy minister Sergio Massa from the governing center-left Peronist coalition.Story continuesArgentina's government also said earlier on Tuesday it is in talks with the country's meat sector to cap domestic prices. Argentines are one of the world's top per capita consumers of beef, which makes its price politically sensitive.Lautaro Moschet, economist at consultancy Fundación Libertad y Progreso, said he expected inflation to speed up in August to around 9.3%, after the recent peso devaluation and additional controls on access to dollars."For August we expect a strong acceleration," he said.Nestor Varela, 62, said there seemed little hope that politicians would - or could - fix the issue any time soon."The issue of inflation really hits your wallet," he said, adding the big question mark was whether the government or big businesses would "really commit themselves to the task of bringing inflation down".

Text Content: (Adds comments from Chinese embassy, congressman's office, paragraphs 7-9)By Christopher Bing and Raphael SatterWASHINGTON, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Republican U.S. Representative Don Bacon late on Monday said the FBI had warned him that his emails had been hacked by Chinese spies, with both personal and campaign messages compromised.Bacon was told the Chinese Communist Party had access to his accounts for about a month ending on June 16, he said on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter.The news was first reported on Monday by the Washington Post.The hack was the result of a "vulnerability in Microsoft software", Bacon said, an apparent reference to the hacking campaign that Microsoft disclosed last month, which reportedly resulted in the theft of hundreds of thousands of emails from senior U.S. officials, including U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and U.S. Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns.CNN previously reported that email accounts in the U.S. House of Representatives were targeted as part of the same campaign."There were other victims in this cyber operation," Bacon said on X. "The Communist government in China are not our friends and are very active in conducting cyber espionage."A Chinese Embassy spokesperson called the development a "smear" and part of a "groundless narrative," adding that the U.S. government had undercut China's sovereignty with recent arms sales to Taiwan, a self-governed island claimed by China.The FBI and Microsoft declined to comment.A spokesperson for Bacon said the FBI had told him that Chinese hackers compromised his email and stole information relating to personal banking, political strategy and campaign fundraising.Bacon, who was elected to Congress in 2016, is a former Air Force brigadier general who currently serves on the House Armed Services Committee, which helps decide the U.S. military's annual budget and spending plans.The congressman was likely targeted, according to his spokesperson, because of his public support for Taiwan and critical commentary about China's treatment of the Uyghur community.

Text Content: JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — Their dreams of representing Indonesia in the 2023 Miss Universe pageant turned to nightmares when they were forced to undergo “body checks” in front of local organizers. Now seven contestants have filed complaints with the police, accusing the organizers of sexual harassment, their lawyer said Tuesday.During the July 29-Aug. 3 Miss Universe Indonesia contest in the capital of Jakarta — and ahead of the show's Grand Final event — the contestants were told to strip to their underwear for “body checks” for scars or cellulite, said lawyer Melissa Anggraini.The checks took place in a ballroom at the downtown Sari Pacific Hotel, where the contest was held, with about two dozen people present, including men. Five of the contestants said they were then photographed topless, Anggraini said.“We have obtained some evidences, even videos showing that the organizer had carried out ‘body checks’,” she added.One of her clients, 23-year-old model Priskila Ribka Jelita who represented West Java province in the pageant, recounted her “body check” ordeal in an interview with The Associated Press.“When they asked me to open my bra ... I was shocked! But I couldn’t speak or refuse," she said. “When I tried to cover my breast with my hand, I was even scolded and yelled at.”“I was totally confused, nervous and humiliated, especially when I was told to lift my left leg on the chair and let them examine my leg,” Jelita said. The “examination” continued up her leg to “my private intimate part,” she added.After news of the “body checks” leaked out, the Miss Universe Organization cut its ties with its Indonesian franchisee. The New York-based organization said in a statement late Saturday that it had decided to sever ties with PT Capella Swastika Karya, the franchisee, and its National Director Poppy Capella.“In light of what we have learned took place at Miss Universe Indonesia, it has become clear that this franchise has not lived up to our brand standards and ethics,” the Miss Universe Organization said on the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter.Story continuesThe organization also said it would be cancelling this year’s Miss Universe Malaysia as the Indonesian franchisee also holds the license for the neighboring country's pageant.It said it would make arrangements for the Indonesia 2023 title holder, Fabienne Nicole Groeneveld, who won in Jakarta, to compete in the upcoming Miss Universe pageant, to be held in El Salvador later this year.Groeneveld was not among the contestants who filed a complaint.Jelita's mother, Maria Napitupulu, said she found out what happened to her daughter only after reading her daughter’s post on Instagram, where she recounted the ordeal.“It’s very sad and this really hurts me,” Napitupulu said, tears streaming down her cheeks.In March, Indonesian beauty company PT Capella Swastika Karya took over the license for Miss Universe Indonesia from Yayasan Putri Indonesia, or YPI, an Indonesian foundation that had held the license for 30 years.Capella, a former singer and the franchisee's manager, could not be reached for comment.In a post on the franchisee's Instagram account, Capella on Saturday denied she had any knowledge of or was in any way involved in any “body checking” of the contestants. She also said that she was against every form of “violence and sexual harassment.”In its statement, the Miss Universe Organization said no measurements of height, weight, or body dimensions are required to join the pageant, and thanked the Indonesian contestants who have shown "bravery in speaking out.”Since the “body checks” news broke, controversy over the pageant has been mounting in Indonesia, the world’s most populous Muslim-majority nation. The country has a reputation as a tolerant, pluralist society that respects freedom of expression.Most Muslims in Indonesia, a secular country of 277 million people, are moderate, but a small hard-line fringe has become more vocal in recent years.In 2013, several conservative Muslim groups staged a massive protest against the Miss World competition in Indonesia, prompting the organizers to move the contest from Jakarta to the resort island of Bali. All of the more than 130 contestants were required to wear Bali’s traditional long sarongs instead of the bikinis that have historically been a symbol of the competition.___Associated Press writer Niniek Karmini in Jakarta, Indonesia, contributed to this report.

Before the primary vote, IMF representatives had already anticipated intensifying talks with opposition members to gauge how they’d want to address the $44 billion program, Bloomberg News reported last month.The IMF press office didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.Milei also said on Tuesday he would approach the program’s fiscal targets by slashing public spending from the political sector.“The big difference in the program we are proposing is we are going to go against politics, the places where politicians rob,” he added.--With assistance from Eric Martin.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: (Updates throughout; adds byline) By Karen Brettell and David Randall NEW YORK, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields hit an almost 10-month high on Tuesday before quickly dipping, after data showed July retail sales rose more than expected. Retail sales jumped 0.7% last month, above the 0.4% forecast. June data was revised higher to show sales rising 0.3% instead of the previously reported 0.2%. Americans boosted online purchases and dined out more, suggesting the U.S. economy continues to expand and putting recession fears at bay. Resilient U.S. data has also boosted expectations that the Federal Reserve may hold rates higher for longer to bring inflation down closer to its 2% annual target. Markets have priced in "a considerably higher probability that we stay around the current terminal rate for a longer period than was previously expected," said Jonathan Cohn, head of U.S. rates desk strategy at Nomura in New York. Benchmark 10-year yields hit 4.274%, the highest since Oct. 24, before falling to 4.197% in early afternoon trading. Two-year yields reached 5.024%, the highest since July 7, before retreating to 4.940%. The interest rate-sensitive notes are holding below the 5.120% yield reached on July 6, the highest since June 2007. The inversion in the closely watched yield curve between two- and 10-year notes narrowed to minus 75 basis points. The Fed will release minutes from its July 25-26 meeting on Wednesday. The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City's annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, on Aug. 24-26 could also deliver clarity on Fed thinking. Futures markets are now pricing in a nearly 35% chance that the Fed's benchmark rate will be above its current range at its December meeting, up from a roughly 25% chance seen a month ago. The market is evaluating "how far the sell-off can run" before the Fed releases minutes of its previous meeting Thursday afternoon, said Benjamin Jeffery, U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- A federal agency has ordered the owner of the controversial Mountain Valley Pipeline to undertake a series of safety inspections on the 300-mile project, arguing that segments of pipe left exposed or buried underground for years amid project delays could pose a safety risk.The review, issued by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, has the potential to result in cumbersome and expensive fixes for Equitrans Midstream Corp., which has already seen its project held up by legal challenges by environmental groups for years.“The commissioning and operation of the MVP pipeline without appropriate inspection and corresponding corrective measures first being undertaken would pose a pipeline integrity risk to public safety, property, and the environment,” the agency said in a Notice of Proposed Safety Order.Read More: Supreme Court Lets Work Resume on Manchin-Backed Gas PipeThe order was issued Friday, the same day a US Appeals Court rejected a challenge by environmentalists to the $6.6 billion project, and comes as the condition of the pipeline becomes a new battleground for the project.Natalie Cox, an Equitrans spokeswoman, said the company has requested an informal consultation with PHMSA and the project remains targeted for completion by the end of the year.“While the proposed preliminary findings do not present an accurate view of the extraordinary efforts we have taken to ensure the safety and integrity of the pipeline, which has faced unprecedented delays due to circumstances beyond our control, Mountain Valley remains committed to working with PHMSA and other regulators as the project enters the final phase of construction,” Cox said in an email.Story continuesEarlier this summer, environmental groups urged federal agencies, including PHMSA, to impose additional safety measures for the pipeline’s construction, including requiring any needed fixes to be done at a plant indoors, which in some cases could mean uninstalling pipeline segments so it could be hauled away.“We appreciate the concerns community members have been raising for years are in focus,” said Jessica Sims, Virginia field coordinator for the environmental group Appalachian Voices. “The materials for the Mountain Valley Pipeline have in some cases been sitting in the sun for six years.”PHMSA, in its safety order, noted that segments of the pipe have been buried with out certain corrosion protections installed or exposed to the elements and ultraviolet radiation “for long periods of time.” In addition, the safety agency said it observed pipe placed “within a rock-laden trench without adequate support” to protect the pipeline’s coating to damage.The agency ordered Equitrans to do third-party testing on the pipeline coating for nearly the entire length of the pipeline and conduct analysis on all pipe stored in outdoor locations by an independent, among other testing as well as submit a work plan to make any needed fixes.--With assistance from Ruth Liao.(Updates with response from company spokeswoman in fifth paragraph.)©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Representatives of the multitrillion-dollar insurance industry are hurling criticism at a proposal that could make it harder to invest in deals sold in fast-growing private markets that offer higher yields but often bring added risks.The proposal by a unit of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, a consortium of state regulators that sets standards for the industry, would allow the group to override credit ratings assigned to some deals, in turn affecting how much money insurance companies could allocate to those deals. The NAIC group says it’s necessary in part because more deals are being done in little-regulated private markets.Money managers and other industry groups are staunchly opposed. The impacts are already being felt, they say, as some insurance firms place moratoriums on certain deals until there’s more clarity.“The current NAIC proposals have already had a major market disruption as word of the impending proposal permeates all levels of the insurance industry,” according to a letter by Jacques de Saint Phalle, head of debt capital markets at Piper Sandler. His opinion was read aloud at a Monday meeting in Seattle to discuss the plan.The proposal under discussion would allow the NAIC’s Securities Valuation Office to override the credit ratings assigned to deals in which its own risk assessment is three or more notches different than the one assigned by an official credit rating organization, such as Kroll Bond Rating Agency and Egan-Jones Ratings Co. As a result, an increasing number of insurance companies have instituted a moratorium on purchasing Kroll and Egan-Jones rated transactions in these markets, according to Piper Sandler.Story continues“Egan-Jones has a leading market position in private debt in part as a result of our excellent performance,” said Eric Mandelbaum, deputy general counsel at Egan-Jones, in emailed comments. “In 2022 we only had one default (compared to 50+ implied by our rating levels) and it was a ‘soft’ default for a covenant violation (and not payment) and in 2020 no defaults.”Representatives for the NAIC declined to comment. Kroll didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.Industry criticisms of the proposal center on the fact that the SVO, which has a far smaller staff than any of the national ratings companies, would effectively be assigning its own ratings in cases where it chose to do so. It isn’t itself a ratings firm and isn’t regulated like one, critics said.“The NRSROs are subject to a robust regulatory regime and have transparent methodologies which are available on their website for investors,” Mandelbaum said, using an acronym to refer to the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations, which includes Egan-Jones.The proposed change could have big implications for US insurance companies, which reported $8.2 trillion in total cash and invested assets at the end of 2022. They’re closely bound by rules that limit the size of their investments in riskier assets. If the credit ratings of some deals are rejected in place of lower ratings by the NAIC group, then it could limit participation from the industry.The SVO says the policy is necessary in order to protect against too much reliance on traditionally assigned ratings, in part by bringing transparency to less-regulated private markets. Evidence of some the risks emerged in 2022, when a new regulatory requirement brought to light a number of examples in which deals executed in private markets received substantially different ratings from different credit graders, said Charles Therriault, the director of the SVO, at the meeting.“We have observed growing and often material discrepancies between the ratings provided by competing NRSROs for the same security,” said Therriault. “The rating exceptions identified by the SVO to the task force only came about because of the requirement for increased regulatory transparency into these non-public transactions. Otherwise, the task force would continue to be completely blind to these issues.”A decade of low interest rates has drawn many insurers away from traditional public markets toward non-traditional and private markets, increasing the need for careful assessments of risk, NAIC’s president and president-elect wrote recently in a letter to members of Congress who had objected to the proposed rule.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: (Reuters) - The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) said on Wednesday it has asked the country's general insurers to improve their claims handling practices and resources after it found issues in multiple areas in its review of the companies.The regulator said it had commenced several investigations related to claims handling practices after its review of more than 218,000 insurance claims lodged between January and March 2022 of six insurers, including Insurance Australia Group, QBE Insurance and Suncorp.The claims reviewed by the ASIC revealed the insurers were facing unduly pressure due to inclement weather events during and before the period. It also pointed out areas of improvement such as communications, project management and resourcing."All five areas we've identified for improvement are within the insurers’ control. Improving claims handling practices and resourcing will make an immediate and positive difference to consumers," ASIC Deputy Chair Karen Chester said.Insurance Australia Group, QBE Insurance and Suncorp did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.(Reporting by Archishma Iyer in Bengaluru; Editing by Shinjini Ganguli)

III to create One Power Co., listing on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ONEP.“This merger with TRTL is a monumental step toward our vision of reshaping the utility industry,” Jereme Kent, founder and chief executive officer of One Energy, said in a statement, referring to the SPAC by its ticker. “With the added financial strength, we can expedite our growth plans, helping industrial clients transition to a more sustainable, reliable, and cost-effective power solution that is catered to their individual needs.”Kent, who said he came up with the idea of One Energy while in a bar in Minnesota, chose the SPAC option for the next stage in the company’s growth instead of taking private capital so he could retain control of the company.“I’m a firm believer that I see the long term vision of this company and I’ve yet to meet the infrastructure fund that fully understood that,” Kent said in an interview. “And so I’d like to stay in charge and I’d like to continue to grow this company into what I think it can be.”The deal has been structured to be more shareholder friendly than a typical SPAC deal with current One Energy shareholders rolling 100% of their equity into the combined company. Kent is taking a three-year lockup, while the board and the sponsor, Hennessy Capital Growth Partners, are taking a two-year lockup on their shares.Story continuesA total of 5.6 million shares have been committed to a contingent share rights (CSR) escrow structure to support non-redemptions and PIPE investment.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis President Neel Kashkari said there’s been positive action on controlling US inflation but the rate of price growth is more than policymakers are prepared to tolerate.“Right now inflation is coming down — we’ve made some good progress,” Kashkari said Tuesday at a conference in Minneapolis. “It’s still too high.”Kashkari, a voter on monetary policy this year, said he’s “been surprised that the economy has been very resilient” and that the labor market “has remained very strong” in the face of the Fed’s aggressive rate-hike campaign to ease inflation.“It’s a little bit of a double-edged sword, because the question in my mind is, ‘have we done enough to actually get inflation all the way back down to our 2% mark, or do we have to do more’,” he said.Policymakers delivered a quarter-point hike at their meeting last month, bringing the federal funds rate to a range of 5.25% to 5.5%. That increase came after a pause at the June meeting, where officials simultaneously signaled that two further increases might be necessary this year.The US central bank has been raising rates in an attempt to slow inflation that in 2022 reached a 40-year high. Price growth has cooled substantially since then, but still remains well above the Fed’s 2% annual target rate.While a report last week showed that inflation continued to moderate in July, with core prices posting the smallest back-to back gains in more than two years, robust retail-sales data Tuesday showed that US consumers continue to be resilient.Officials have said that they’re carefully assessing incoming data as they craft policy.Story continuesPolicymakers meet again Sept. 19-20 to decide on rates.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: NEW YIORK (AP) — Opera News, an 87-year-old publication focused on the Metropolitan Opera and spotlighting the art form in the U.S., will print its final issue in November and be incorporated into Britain-based Opera magazine.The Met announced Tuesday that the Metropolitan Opera Guild, a separate company formed in 1935 by Eleanor Belmont to aid the opera house, will scale back operations and become a supporting organization of the Met. The opera company will take over the education program that allows about 12,000 school children each year to attend dress rehearsals.Opera News has a 43,000 circulation, including 32,000 in print and 11,000 digital. It is distributed to 28,000 Guild members and has an additional 9,000 paid subscribers. After publishing biweekly during the opera season since 1940, Opera News added monthly summer editions in 1972 and switched to a year-round monthly schedule in 2008.“It really is the result of several years of declining economic fortunes,” Met general manager Peter Gelb said. “What they’re suffering is what many non-profits have been suffering, which is a situation where the earned revenues and donations are not enough to keep up with the expenses.”Eleanor Belmont, a philanthropist married to financier August Belmont Jr., founded the guild to increase public support for the Met at a time the company's finances were struggling during the Great Depression.The guild had revenue of $3.2 million in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2022, a drop from $4 million in the prior year. That was down from $11.9 million in the year ending June 30, 2019, the last before the coronavirus pandemic.The Met said 20 Guild employees will get severance packages but the opera company hoped to hire several. Guild board members are being invited to join the Met board. The annual Opera News Awards and luncheon honoring singers will be discontinued.Opera magazine has 20,000 print subscribers and estimates it has 60,000 readers. It has a four-person editorial office.John Allison, Opera’s editor, said it had not yet been decided whether to arrange a U.S. printing plant. Rebecca Paller, who has written for Opera, will become its U.S. editor, and Opera will add a focus on Met theater telecasts and radio broadcasts,“We’ve always covered the American scene in a lot of detail, and here really what we’ll be doing is just I guess you might say upgrading the American coverage,” Allison said. “In that sense, it should be quite seamless.”

Text Content: Economic data continues to come in stronger than expected, leading economists to push back their calls for a recession and in turn increasingly prompting Wall Street strategists to become more bullish on stocks.On Tuesday, Jefferies upgraded its year-end target for the S&P 500 from 4,050 to 4,500."As a soft landing is the more likely outcome now, earnings will be much more resilient than previously expected" Jefferies global head of microstrategy Desh Permunetilleke.With the Artificial Intelligence rally that sent price targets higher before the summer now cooling off during second quarter earnings reports, strategists have turned to the resilient US economy as the next catalyst to support the market rally.From a Taylor Swift and Barbie shoutout at the most recent Federal Reserve press conference, to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) surprising to the upside in the second quarter, a US consumer that's still willing to spend more than many thought possible has been at the forefront of the economic story during the summer of 2023.And as each rosier than expected data point rolls in, discussions about a so-called "soft landing" conclusion to the Fed's hiking cycle, where inflation stabilizes without economic growth taking a significant downturn, have intensified and become the latest talking point strategists point to when explaining why the S&P 500 is likely to end 2023 higher than Wall Street expected. On July 31, Citi Citi managing director Scott Chronert boosted his 2023 S&P 500 closing price to 4,600 from 4,000 and its mid-2024 target to 5,000 from 4,400. Chronert wrote that new target reflected a "increased probability of a soft landing." On August 1, Oppenheimer Asset Management boosted its S&P 500 year-end price target to 4,900 from 4,400."Our price target assumes that the resilience exhibited by the US economy will continue along with a high level of sensitivity by the Federal Reserve in raising its benchmark rates further to slow the inflation rate toward its 2% target," Oppenheimer chief investment strategist John Stoltzfus wrote.Story continuesThis content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Personal consumption makes up about 70% of US GDP and many indicators that contribute to consumption have shown resiliency. The labor market has come off pandemic-highs but is still adding jobs alongside a historically low unemployment rate and increasing wages. Early indicators are consumers have kept spending to start the third quarter, too, with July's retail sales report showing sales increased 0.7% in the month.While not red hot, the economic indicators are showing signs of what Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatizus has dubbed "unspectacular growth." And that could be enough to keep stocks higher while presenting buying opportunities in certain sectors.On Monday, Bank of America upgraded the consumer discretionary sector (XLY) to Overweight from Underweight, citing its economics team's recent call that the Fed's rate hike cycle won't end in a recession."Our economists forecast a soft landing, but investors appear positioned for a [Great Financial Crisis]-style recession," Subramanian wrote in a new note on Monday.

Text Content: (Updated at 4 pm ET/ 2000 GMT)*July retail sales rise more than expected*Nvidia gains as UBS, Wells Fargo raise PT*U.S. big banks fall as a report warns of downgradesBy Saeed Azhar, Amruta Khandekar and Shristi Achar ANEW YORK, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main stock indexes closed lower on Tuesday after stronger-than-expected retail sales data stoked worries interest rates could stay higher for longer, while U.S. big banks dropped on a report that Fitch could downgrade some lenders.The Commerce Department report showed retail sales grew 0.7% last month against expectations of a 0.4% rise, suggesting the U.S. economy remains strong.After the data, traders' bets of a pause on hikes by the Federal Reserve next month stayed intact at 89%, yet analysts said investors were worried rates could stay at current levels longer than anticipated.Banks saw the brunt of the selling as investors grew more anxious about interest rates. The U.S. Treasury yield curve has been inverted for over a year, with longer-term bonds yielding less than short-term debt instruments. This persistent situation pressures profits that banks can earn on loans."We would probably end up with an inverted yield curve for longer than anticipated, even if we don't end up with an economic recession," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research."That would end up curtailing lending because even if you were my brother-in-law, I wouldn't want to lend to you at a loss."According to preliminary data, the S&P 500 lost 51.60 points, or 1.15%, to end at 4,438.12 points, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 155.81 points, or 1.13%, to 13,632.52. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 356.33 points, or 1.01%, to 34,951.30.A report said ratings agency Fitch could downgrade multiple banks. Shares of JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo fell sharply."The story from Fitch about potential downgrades to multiple U.S. banks (is) weighing on sentiment," said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities.Story continues"You combine that with the retail sales figures this morning that were a little hotter than estimates, (it) furthers the potential higher for longer rates scenario from the Fed."Shares of regional lenders PacWest Bancorp, Zions Bancorp and Western Alliance Bank slipped after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp's latest regulatory overhaul proposal.The S&P 500 banking index hit a one-month low, while the KBW regional banking index also plunged.All 11 major S&P 500 sectors declined, with energy stocks leading losses on weaker crude prices.Technology stocks fared better, thanks to gains in shares of Nvidia after UBS and Wells Fargo lifted their price targets on the stock.Nvidia posted its biggest one-day percentage gain since late May in the previous session following bullish comments from Morgan Stanley, with analysts also saying investors were piling into the stock in the run-up to its earnings next week.U.S.-listed shares of Chinese companies also dropped with e-commerce firm Alibaba Group among those leading the slide after another round of disappointing economic data from Among other stocks, General Motors fell after Berkshire Hathaway cut its stake in the automaker.Warren Buffett's Berkshire disclosed a new investment in homebuilder D.R.

Text Content: By Rachel SavageJOHANNESBURG, Aug 15 (Reuters) - The development bank founded by the so-called BRICS countries closed the auction for its first South African rand bonds on Tuesday, as it comes under pressure to boost its local currency fundraising and lending.The New Development Bank's (NDB) two bonds, a 1 billion rand ($52.3 million) five year note and a 500 million rand three year note, attracted 2.67 billion rand of bids in total, according to auction results shared by two investors with Reuters.South Africa's finance minister said that the NDB, which was founded to give the BRICS members - Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa - more control of development financing, was not doing enough local currency lending, in an interview with Reuters ahead of the BRICS summit in Johannesburg next week.The NDB did not respond to a request for comment on the bond auction.Chief Financial Officer Leslie Maasdorp told Reuters in a recent interview that the bank aims to increase local currency lending, most of which has so far been in Chinese Yuan, from about 22% to 30% by 2026, but that there were limits to de-dollarisation.NDB's three year rand bond was priced at a floating rate of 95 basis points (bps) above the three month Johannesburg Interbank Average Rate (Jibar), while the five year was priced at Jibar +105 bps.The most recent comparable South African government bonds were a 4.5 year bond priced at Jibar +90 bps and a seven year priced at Jibar +120 bps, said Raphi Rootshtain, a portfolio manager at Sasfin Wealth."It is interesting to note that most of the underlying lending activities in South Africa are to State Owned Companies (SOEs)," Rootshtain said. "So effectively the NDB will become the new proxy funding vehicle for SOEs which should come with additional risk."The bond sale was arranged by Standard Bank, which declined to comment, and Absa Bank, which did not reply to a request for comment.($1 = 19.1206 rand)(Reporting by Rachel Savage; Editing by Josie Kao)

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Lending for commercial real estate in the US has plunged — and it isn’t just banks that are holding back.Funds affiliated with major investors such as Blackstone Inc., KKR & Co. and Starwood Capital Group also have reduced originations, even as rising interest rates offered the opportunity for fatter returns.The dollar volume of new commercial-property loans by investor-driven lenders, such as private equity and debt funds, tumbled 60% in the second quarter from a year earlier, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported Tuesday. Bank originations slid 69%, according to the data, which includes multifamily financing.While new loans at higher rates are potentially lucrative for investors, concerns are mounting that defaults will increase as property valuations fall and landlords struggle to keep up with payments on floating-rate debt. Lenders can’t easily hike costs without putting more borrowers at risk of distress, so they’ve decided it’s better to wait, said Lisa Pendergast, executive director of the Commercial Real Estate Finance Council.“Bank and nonbank lenders alike realize that cash is king in today’s environment,” Pendergast said in an email. “So they have to stockpile cash under the assumption that more of their borrowers will suffer distress going forward.”Read more: Property Loans Are So Unappealing That Banks Want to Dump ThemCommercial-property prices fell 10% in the year through June, MSCI Real Assets reported. The rate of commercial mortgage-backed securities that were delinquent or in workouts with special servicers climbed to 6.44% in July from 6.07% the prior month, according to Kroll Bond Rating Agency.Story continuesMaturing DebtWith building sales at a near standstill, there’s less of a demand for deal financing. But many borrowers still need new loans to replace current debt that’s maturing. The Mortgage Bankers Association estimated that $728 billion in commercial and multifamily debt is coming due this year.Banks are under increasing pressure from regulators to reduce exposure to commercial real estate, after this year’s collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank. All had significant property-lending businesses.For nonbank lenders, it’s more about keeping their powder dry until the smoke clears around interest-rate increases and valuations, according to Jamie Woodwell, MBA’s head of commercial real estate research.“Our hope and expectation is that the logjam starts to break as there’s greater certainty,” Woodwell said in an interview.Private equity and debt funds have been expanding their share of the commercial-mortgage market for more than a decade as banks faced tighter regulations following the 2008 global financial crisis. They often specialize in shorter-term, floating-rate loans with higher interest rates than banks offer.Sitting on CashDebt funds that provide commercial-property financing, including publicly traded mortgage real estate investment trusts, are for now more focused bolstering liquidity and increasing provisions for nonperforming debt.Blackstone Mortgage Trust Inc., for example, decreased its loan portfolio in the second quarter to $23.1 billion as it focused on increasing cash and reducing leverage. KKR Real Estate Finance Trust Inc. said it originated no new mortgages in the period.Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance Inc. shrank its $8 billion loan portfolio by about $400 million in the first six months of this year. It’s earning about 5% on its cash without taking the risk of issuing new loans, according to Chief Investment Officer Scott Weiner.“To the extent the repayments are higher than we expect and we’re sitting on more cash, then we can always look to turn back on the originations,” Weiner said on an Aug. 1 call with investors. “But at this point, it’s not something we’re going to be doing in the near term.”©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: By Paul Lienert(Reuters) - Our Next Energy, the Michigan-based electric vehicle battery startup, said its new Aries II battery pack is capable of providing 350 miles (565 km)of range between charges while avoiding the use of expensive materials such as nickel and cobalt.ONE’s Aries II cells use cathodes made of lithium iron phosphate. LFP cells are less expensive, safer and more sustainable than those that use nickel-cobalt-manganese (NCM) cathodes, but typically provide far less range.The Aries II cells have significantly narrowed the performance gap between LFP and NCM, ONE Founder and Chief Executive Mujeeb Ijaz said at a media briefing on Tuesday.The Aries II packs are slated to go into pilot production late next year at ONE’s new factory in Van Buren Township in southeastern Michigan.Ijaz said the company’s dual-chemistry Gemini pack will boost EV range to 600 miles (965 km) and is scheduled to go into production in 2025-2026.Gemini marries LFP cells similar to those used in the Aries pack with higher-energy cells that act as a range extender as charge is depleted. The range-extender cells use cathodes with no cobalt and 75% less nickel, along with lithium metal anodes that use no graphite.Ijaz said the cost target with Gemini is $50 per kilowatt-hour at the pack level — less than half the typical cost of today’s NCM packs.That would put the cost of a 185kWh Gemini pack at around $9,250. Today’s battery packs can cost from $12,000 to $20,000, depending on battery size, weight, chemistry and output.(Reporting by Paul Lienert in Detroit; editing by Jonathan Oatis)

Text Content: Aug 15 (Reuters) - The indictment of former U.S. President Donald Trump and 18 others in Georgia includes charges against three alleged co-conspirators related to the harassment of election workers. The involvement of the trio – Trevian Kutti, Harrison Floyd and Stephen Cliffgard Lee – in efforts to keep Trump in power was first revealed by Reuters in a series of reports in 2021 and 2022.THE CHARGES Kutti, Floyd and Lee are charged with solicitation of false statements and influencing witnesses for their efforts to compel Ruby Freeman, an election worker in Georgia’s Fulton County, into making a bogus confession to voting fraud in January 2021.The three men did not respond to requests for comment on Tuesday.Trump has denied all the charges against him as a politicized effort to keep him from regaining the presidency.THE BACKSTORYFollowing the November 2020 vote, Freeman and her daughter, Wandrea “Shaye” Moss, were falsely accused by Trump and his campaign of illegally counting phony mail-in ballots after pulling them from mysterious suitcases while working on Election Day at Atlanta’s State Farm Arena. In fact, the “suitcases” were standard ballot containers, and the votes were properly counted, county and state officials quickly confirmed, refuting the fraud claims.TREVIAN KUTTI As Reuters reported, Trevian Kutti, a publicist, traveled to Georgia days before the Jan. 6, 2021, riot and showed up uninvited at Freeman’s door. Kutti told Freeman she was sent by a “high-profile individual,” whom she didn’t identify, to deliver Freeman a message: Freeman was in unspecified danger, “due to the election,” and had just 48 hours to “get ahead of the issue” before unknown people were going to show up at her home.In an Instagram post after that article was published, Kutti denied pressuring Freeman to falsely admit fraud.Kutti had been identifying herself publicly as a member of “the Young Black Leadership Council under President Donald Trump.” She also had claimed to work for Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, and that her clients included the Queen of Jordan. A spokesperson for the queen denied any involvement with Kutti; a representative for Ye said Kutti wasn’t associated with the rapper when she met Freeman.Story continuesHARRISON FLOYD In a follow-up article, Reuters reported that Trump campaign aide Harrison Floyd, executive director of a group called Black Voices for Trump, told the news organization he had recruited Kutti to meet with Freeman. Floyd said he then participated by phone in a meeting Kutti held with Freeman at a police station in Georgia’s Cobb County.Floyd told Reuters he was asked if he’d be willing to set up the meeting by a man he described as a chaplain with “connections” in federal law enforcement. He declined to name the clergyman or to detail his connections. Floyd said he arranged the meeting to help Freeman. Floyd said the chaplain, who is white, wanted him to approach Freeman, who is Black, to discuss an immunity deal for her, out of a belief that she would not trust a white stranger. Floyd and Kutti are Black.STEPHEN LEE In September 2022, Reuters identified Stephen Lee, an Illinois-based former police officer, as the man who sought Floyd’s help with Freeman, drawing on police bodycam footage and other reporting. In December 2020, Reuters reported, Lee had visited Freeman’s house himself but was turned away by the frightened election worker. Lee, in a brief interview at his home in Montgomery, Illinois, did not dispute that he visited Freeman but declined to discuss why or whether someone had sent him. Lee formerly worked as a police officer in California and later served as a chaplain comforting officers and others after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in New York. The hounding of Freeman and Moss upended their lives, unleashing a wave of death threats against them and forcing Freeman to flee her home, as Reuters chronicled. They later described their ordeal in dramatic testimony before the U.S. House’s Jan. 6 committee. (Reporting by Jason Szep and Lindo So; Editing by Daniel Wallis)

Argentines are one of the world's top consumers of beef, making its price politically sensitive."Without agreement, there will be no export permits," the government source had said, asking not to be named.Argentina is facing a tense three-way battle in presidential elections to be held in October after an upset in primaries on Sunday saw a dark horse radical gain the largest share of the vote, with the ruling Peronist coalition in overall third place.Argentina's meat export chamber Consorcio ABC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Text Content: NEW YORK (AP) — WeWork has sounded the alarm on its ability to stay in business, prompting speculation around the future of the troubled workspace-sharing company.Last week, WeWork warned there was “substantial doubt” about the New York-based company's “ability to continue as a going concern” — which is accounting-speak for having the resources needed to operate and stay in business. WeWork pointed to increased member churn, financial losses and the company's need for cash, among other factors, over the next year.This isn't the first time the future of WeWork has been uncertain. The company went public in October 2021 after a spectacular collapse during its first attempt to do so two years earlier — which led to the ouster of its CEO and co-founder, Adam Neumann. WeWork was valued at $47 billion at one point, before investors started to drop off due to Neumann’s erratic behavior and exorbitant spending.WeWork has made notable efforts to turn the company around since Neumann's departure, with executives pointing to improvements in annual revenue, significant cuts in operating costs and other growth opportunities as workplaces emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic. Still, experts say the risk of bankruptcy is on the table — bringing in questions around implications for the already-weakening world of office real estate.Here's what you need to know.WHAT IS WEWORK?WeWork is a provider of coworking spaces. The company leases buildings and divides them into office areas to sublet to its members, which include small businesses, startups and freelancers who want to avoid paying for permanent office space.WeWork was founded by Neumann and Miguel McKelvey back in 2010. The startup promised to revolutionize workspaces and saw a meteoric rise in its early years, but over time, WeWork’s operating expenses soared and the company relied on repeated cash infusions from private investors.Since Neumann’s 2019 ouster, the company has seen several leadership changes. Most recently, Sandeep Mathrani, who joined WeWork in 2020, stepped down in May — bringing David Tolley into the position of interim CEO.Story continues“WeWork’s challenges are a legacy of its earlier and very aggressive expansion... And the costs (that the company bears from) that expansion continue,” said Sam Chandan, director of the Chao-Hon Chen Institute for Global Real Estate Finance at New York University’s Stern School of Business. “By many measures, company revenues and performance is improving, but not quickly enough.”As of June 30, WeWork had 777 systemwide locations across 39 countries, the company said in last week's earnings call. Of that, WeWork reported supporting 906,000 workstations and 653,000 physical memberships — equating to 72% physical occupancy. That's down slightly from the 75% physical occupancy seen at 779 systemwide locations WeWork reported operating at the end of 2022.On Tuesday midday trading, WeWork's market capitalization stood at roughly $474 million. Shares were down more than 86% year end to date.IS WEWORK CLOSING ITS DOORS?No, at least not yet. But risk of bankruptcy is on the table, experts say.WeWork has not filed for bankruptcy since last week's announcement, and “anything is a possibility,” Samuel Rosen, assistant professor of finance at Temple University's Fox School of Business, notes. “Whether or not this particular company... can actually get out of its current situation, that’s yet to be seen. History would say it’s possible, although I don't know if I would say it’s probable.”There's also a big difference between liquidation bankruptcy and restructuring bankruptcy. Depending on the type of filing, bankruptcy could help mitigate some challenges WeWork faces through reorganization and other efficiency efforts, Rosen said — noting debt collectors will sometimes push for bankruptcy sooner rather than later, because they don't want to see “risky action that would put their claims at further risk.”WeWork did not comment directly on the prospect of bankruptcy. In a Tuesday statement to The Associated Press, a spokesperson said, “our members remain our top priority and we are resolutely focused on delivering for them for the long term.”In last week's earnings call, the company said that its ability to stay in operation is contingent upon improving its liquidity and profitability over the next 12 months. WeWork plans to negotiate more favorable lease terms, control spending and seek additional capital by issuing debt, stock or selling assets, the company said.Tolley sounded an optimistic note in the company’s results for the second quarter, during which WeWork lost $349 million. While the interim CEO acknowledged factors impacting higher member churn and softer demand, Tolley said that “the company’s transformation continues at pace" — pointing to “a laser focus on member retention and growth, doubling down on our real estate portfolio optimization efforts, and maintaining a disciplined approach to reducing operating costs.”WHAT IS WEWORK'S IMPACT ON COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE?Again, WeWork isn’t going out of business yet — and a bankruptcy filing might not lead to large location closures. But concerns around the company's future brings attention to WeWork's footprint in commercial real estate.According to a recent Securities and Exchange Commision filing, WeWork was operating 43.9 million rentable square feet around the world as of December 2022 — including 18.3 million rentable square feet in the U.S. and Canada.When looking at the total office inventory in the United States alone, 18 million square feet “is a small fraction,” Chandan said — but of course, if WeWork “discontinued meeting its its lease obligations, whether it’s part of a bankruptcy restructuring or some other event... for buildings that have exposure to WeWork, that would be a significant hit.”Concerns about WeWork's future come at a time when leasing demand for office space is weak overall, Chandan added. The COVID-19 pandemic notably led to rising vacancies in office space as working from home became increasingly popular. Major U.S. markets still struggling to improve occupancy in commercial real estate include San Francisco, New York, Chicago and Washington.At the same time, there is a strong market for co-working space, Chandan said — noting that “WeWork is operating in a significantly more competitive market” than it was just several years ago, with a greater variety of options and amenities available to those looking to rent office space today.There's a “really important distinction” between WeWork's current financial position and questions around the future of the co-working model as a whole, he said. “Those are two separate things.”

Text Content: By Laura Sanicola and Shariq KhanAug 15 (Reuters) - U.S. motorists are squeezing out one last trip before Memorial Day holiday and school begins, as pump prices surge to their highest level this year on tighter gasoline supplies.Consumers tend to get a break from steeper fuel costs as peak vacation travel ebbs. But strong demand and a series of refinery outages have pushed the national average retail price to $3.86 per gallon on Tuesday, according to the American Automobile Association - 7% higher than a month ago. In California and Washington, prices have surged above $5 a gallon.National retail gasoline prices will average $3.90 a gallon this month, predict analysts at Goldman Sachs.Martin Jones, a vacationer from Massachusetts, filled up his Toyota Corolla during a sightseeing trip to Washington, D.C., on Tuesday. Jones said he was relieved prices were not close to the $5 a gallon level of last summer."Or I won't be able to make long drives like this as easily," Jones said.Retail prices in the U.S. Midwest jumped as much as 21 cents a gallon in Ohio and 16 cents in Michigan in the last week on earlier-than-expected maintenance at a BP refinery in Whiting, Indiana.Irving Oil's 320,000-barrel-per-day oil refinery in New Brunswick, Canada, and Delta's 185,000-barrel-per-day refinery in Trainer, Pennsylvania, will be down for much of September and part of October, affecting about 9% of the product supplied in their regions.BELOW-AVERAGE STOCKS"It is fairly abnormal to see prices going up" at this time of the year, said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at price tracker GasBuddy.com. "We tend to see prices declining going into the fall."Weekly U.S. gasoline stockpiles have remained below the five-year average of inventories throughout this year, setting the stage for price spikes if refining capacity is disrupted. Total U.S. gasoline stocks this month fell to 216.4 million barrels, the fifth decline in six weeks, according to U.S. government data.At the same time, record heat levels in Texas have likely led to a sharp 2% slump in U.S. refiners' product yields over the past few weeks, Goldman Sachs noted on Sunday. Small changes to the yield often add up to a meaningful decline in product availability, the bank added.Peak hurricane season is still ahead with the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) last week raising its outlook for storms due in part to record warm sea surface temperatures. Hurricanes can result in damage to or closures of U.S. oil refineries, particularly along the Gulf Coast. (Reporting by Laura Sanicola and Shariq Khan; editing by Stephanie Kelly and Aurora Ellis)

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- OpenAI said its technology is capable of moderating content, a task that could help businesses become more efficient, and highlighting a possible use case for buzzy artificial intelligence tools that haven’t yet generated huge revenue for many companies.The startup said its latest technology, GPT-4, which powers ChatGPT, can be used to develop policies on appropriate content and can more quickly label or make decisions about posts. The company has been testing the technology and has invited customers to also experiment with it. OpenAI said its tools can help businesses perform six months of work in just a day or so.Andrea Vallone, who works on policy at OpenAI, said the startup has found that GPT-4 does an efficient job of moderation, a role that often falls to small armies of human workers. Those jobs can sometimes be traumatic for the people performing them. At the same time, many large companies, including Meta Platforms Inc., already use artificial intelligence to help with moderation alongside staffers. Using technology to interpret the nuances of human writing can be challenging, and OpenAI has stressed that the process should not be fully automated.Drafting content moderation policies and labeling content is often a lengthy undertaking. OpenAI’s tools will help reduce the “delta between the need and the solution,” Vallone said.Ideally, a company’s human workers will be able to use technology to free them up to focus on more complicated decisions related to the most extreme cases of potential content violations and how to refine policies, she said. “We’ve continued to have human review to verify some of the model judgements,” she said. “I think it’s important to have humans in the loop always.”Story continues©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: (Adds details from decision, background, case citation, byline)By Jonathan StempelAug 15 (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Tuesday revived a lawsuit in which the U.S and Virginia accused Walgreens Boots Alliance of falsely representing that some patients were eligible for Medicaid coverage for expensive hepatitis C drugs.In a 3-0 decision, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia cleared the way for the pharmacy chain to face claims it violated the federal False Claims Act and Virginia state law.The case arose from accusations that between January 2015 and June 2016, a clinical pharmacy manager at a Walgreens in Kingsport, Tennessee, falsified patient records, including lab results, to obtain prior authorization from Virginia Medicaid for reimbursement for the drugs Sovaldi, Harvoni and Daklinza.Revenue from the Kingsport store grew by 321% during that time, court records showed.Walgreens began an investigation into the alleged fraud but did not repay money it received for 12 Virginia Medicaid patients, even after the manager pleaded guilty to a similar scheme in Tennessee.In December 2021, a trial judge dismissed the governments' lawsuit, saying Walgreens' misrepresentations were immaterial because Virginia's prior authorization requirements violated federal law.In Tuesday's decision, however, Circuit Judge Albert Diaz said Walgreens' alleged misrepresentations were material under the False Claims Act because they "did, in fact, influence the decisionmakers" at Virginia Medicaid.He also said the largest U.S. pharmacy chain could not escape liability by attacking Virginia's eligibility requirements as illegal."Allowing Walgreens to avoid liability by challenging Virginia's eligibility criteria only after getting caught would hinder the act's purpose of holding fraudsters accountable," Diaz wrote.Walgreens did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The U.S. Department of Justice and Virginia's attorney general had no immediate comment.The case is U.S. et al v Walgreen Co, 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 22-1491.(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York Editing by Marguerita Choy)

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Hawaiian Electric Industries, which supplies roughly 95% of the state’s residents with power, traces its roots back to 1891, just a decade after King Kalakaua met Thomas Edison to see the incandescent light bulb. Now, the utility is facing what’s shaping up to be the biggest-ever test over its future.Relentless selling on Monday wiped more than a $1 billion from the company’s value as the stock plunged by a third in its biggest loss on record. Shares extended the freefall on Tuesday, shedding about 20%, after Hawaiian Electric was cut to junk by S&P Global Ratings.Investors are dumping holdings amid increasing scrutiny over power equipment as the possible source of the deadly Maui wildfire.Analysts are starting to raise questions over whether Hawaiian Electric, one of the smallest publicly traded US utilities, will be able to withstand the pressure if it does end up being at fault.To be clear: no official cause of the fire, which has become the deadliest in the US in more than a century, has been identified. And it could be weeks — even months — before any investigation is finalized.Still, lawsuits have already been filed against Hawaiian Electric amid reports of downed power lines that were knocked over by strong winds in the lead up to the blazes.Damages from the tragedy have so far reached more than $5.5 billion, according to federal estimates, an amount that dwarfs Hawaiian Electric’s market capitalization of about $2.4 billion as of Monday’s close.“Given the size of the company, I don’t know how they would be able to account for this if they are found negligent or imprudent,” said Shahriar Pourreza, a utility analyst for Guggenheim Securities. “It’s hard to see the company emerging from this tragedy in its current form.”Story continuesHonolulu-based Hawaiian Electric, which operates the Maui Electric utility, declined to comment on its stock price drop and the potential for legal liability. The utility said it’s focused on restoration efforts, damage assessment and local community support.“At this early stage, the causes haven’t been determined,” the company said in a statement. “We will work closely with state and county as they conduct their review.”Lawsuits on behalf of victims were filed that allege the company’s Maui utility was negligently responsible for the wildfire that leveled the historic town of Lahaina.Read More: Why Hawaii’s Power Lines Are Suspect In Maui Fire: QuickTakeIf the utility is held liable in a worst-case scenario, it may be forced to restructure in a bankruptcy, or it could be taken over in a government bailout, Pourreza said. In the near term, Hawaiian Electric could face a liquidity crunch with banks hesitating to loan the company money needed to fund its operations given the potential liability risk, he said.“If you are a lender to the company, I think you’re going to take a step back and say: I’m going to wait to see how things play out,” he said.On Monday, Guggenheim cut its price target for Hawaiian Electric from $32 apiece to $18, warning it could go lower. The shares closed down 34% at $21.46 the same day.Read More: In Search for Hawaii Fires Cause, Lawyers Probe Power LinesThe company has come under criticism for not turning off power despite warnings of critical fire conditions due to predicted dry, gale-force winds. The utility has said that preemptive short-term shutoffs have to be coordinated with first responders, and in Lahaina, electricity powers the pumps that provide the water needed for firefighting.There’s precedent for large wildfire liabilities pushing a utility into a crisis and bankruptcy.PG&E Corp., California’s largest utility, was forced to reorganize in 2019 after its wind-damaged equipment sparked some of the most destructive wildfires in state history resulting in estimated claims of more than $30 billion. The company was threatened with a state takeover, but ultimately reached a Chapter 11 settlement with California that resulted in closer regulatory oversight of its operations and the payment of billions of dollars of claims to fire victims.Read More: Hawaii Wildfires Become More Frequent as Drought Withers GrassIf there is a link to power lines, Hawaiian Electric will have to be shown to be negligent or that it could have reasonably prevented a loss, a higher legal standard than the one applied to utilities in California, according to analysts.“If there was negligence, I would expect all options, including bankruptcy for Maui Electric, to be on the table,” said Jay Rhame, chief executive officer of utility investor Reaves Asset Management. Reaves doesn’t hold shares of Hawaiian Electric in its portfolio, Rhame said.The company’s insurance coverage is likely under $1 billion, Wells Fargo utility analyst Jonathan Reeder said in a note Monday. It’s unclear if the parent company could “ring-fence” potential liabilities within its Maui Electric subsidiary, according to the note.Meanwhile, traditional utility investors will likely stay away from the company’s stock, said Andy Bischof, a utility analyst for Morningstar.“This is something that is going to play out for some time,” Bischof said. “For a utility investor, it’s probably not a risk profile they would be willing to accept.”(Updated Tuesday’s declines in second paragraph.)©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Early pricing discussions on the securities call for a yield of 1.95 percentage points over similar Treasuries, the person added.PNC’s deal is the latest in a string of recent bank bond sales. Bank of America Corp. on Monday sold $5 billion of senior unsecured notes in four parts, while Goldman Sachs Group Inc. issued $1.5 billion of notes. Regional lender Huntington Bancshares Inc. also tapped markets for $1.25 billion of bonds.Read: Goldman, BofA Tap High-Grade Bond Market Before Summer LullThe deals come as companies rush to raise capital before the cyclical summer slowdown that typically kicks in toward the end of August. PNC last issued in early June, when it raised $3.5 billion of bonds.For regional banks, there’s an incentive to tap investment-grade debt markets while funding costs are relatively low. The extra yield investors demand to hold financial bonds over average blue-chip debt has been declining since April, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.On Wall Street, focus has also shifted to proposals from US regulators that would require lenders to raise more capital to protect them from market shocks.

YouTube (GOOGL), Netflix (NFLX), and Amazon Prime Video (AMZN) all saw month-over-month viewership increases of 5.6%, 4.2%, and 5%, respectively, in July."Linear TV [is] past the point of no return," Macquarie analyst Tim Nollen wrote in a note to clients on Monday, adding the revenue line for cable and satellite operators is "probably permanently negative" as pricing fails to drive upside while TV advertising growth stalls."We think the metrics for linear TV are all bad," the analyst continued. "Ad revenue across our media network coverage fell 13% on average in Q2, down from -8% in 1Q, which included the Super Bowl. We forecast the second half of the year will get slightly better, but to remain negative including an off-political year comparison."The data comes as more consumers drop their cable packages in a trend known as cord-cutting and instead opt for streaming services that are traditionally less profitable for media companies.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Still, streaming is not exactly outperforming either, Nollen warned, explaining subscriber numbers at major direct-to-consumer services (DTC) including Peacock, Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+, Paramount+, Max and Discovery+ were down by about 500,000 combined."Global DTC subscriber growth was 8.5% year-over-year (YoY), slowing to single digits for the first time," he wrote, adding the growth was aided by Netflix's password-sharing crackdown, which helped the streamer add 5.9 million subscribers in the second quarter.Story continuesComcast's Peacock (CMCSA) was able to grow its subscriber base 84% year-over-year to 24 million, up from the prior 13 million, as the streamer works to catch up to its peers amid a significant lag."June 26 was the last day for Xfinity subscribers to get Peacock for free," Nollen noted, citing that deadline as a likely catalyst for the subscriber additions. "This pricing trend follows Disney's collective price hikes, with Hulu soon to be the most expensive ad free platform at $17.99. As land grabs for subscribers have slowed, companies have turned to pricing increases to fuel revenue growth."Another area that's fueling revenue growth? Direct-to-consumer advertising, which grew 27% on average across media companies including Disney (DIS), Comcast, Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), and Paramount (PARA). That's double from the 13% growth posted in the first quarter.Nollen said Comcast is the farthest behind, as only 14% of its estimated revenues are expected to come from DTC in 2024 with the other 85% stemming from its linear networks. Disney is the farthest along, with DTC revenue expected to surpass linear network revenue for the first time in 2024.Disney CEO Bob Iger.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc.’s Google will let users experiment with new features that display content created by artificial intelligence while they browse the web, as the company strives to maintain its edge in a market with new competitive threats.Earlier this year, Google released “search generative experience,” or SGE, in which users can try an experimental version of its search engine that displays AI-generated responses above the customary list of results. The company said Tuesday the product would expand to let readers use the AI tool on websites beyond Google’s search engine.The feature “was specifically designed to help people more deeply engage with long-form content from publishers and creators, and make it easier to find what you’re looking for while browsing the web,” Rany Ng, a Google vice president of product management for search, wrote in a blog post.Google has been striving to reinvent its flagship search engine after Microsoft Corp. shook up the market by weaving technology from startup OpenAI into its Bing search engine.Publishers are still grappling with the effects of generative AI, which can spin up text and images from simple prompts. Google said the new feature would generate summaries only for content that is free to read.“It does not provide key points on articles marked as paywalled, and publishers are in control,” Ng wrote, adding that the company will “gather feedback and learn what works best for both publishers and users as we evolve this experiment over time.”Google also announced that it would begin displaying definitions within its AI-generated content and make it easier for people to use SGE for coding.Story continues©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- El Salvador President Nayib Bukele scared off many on Wall Street by embracing Bitcoin. Two years later, the bond rally he’s overseeing is proving too lucrative to resist.Eye-popping 70% returns — the best among dollar bonds from emerging markets this year — are attracting investors who were once cautious or avoiding the securities altogether. JPMorgan Chase & Co, Eaton Vance and PGIM Fixed Income are among those who have recommended or bought the debt, betting it will continue climbing.“Although we missed a significant share of the rally, we still think there’s value across El Salvador’s curve,” JPMorgan research strategists Ben Ramsey, Nishant Poojary and Gorka Lalaguna wrote in a July note, moving overweight on the debt. “There’s room for this credit to keep outperforming.”The optimism demonstrates how Bukele has gained acceptance from both money managers and his peers in Latin America after many had dismissed him as an anti-establishment maverick. His hard-line stance on gangs, which has dramatically cut crime in the country, is influencing politics throughout the region. And his commitment to paying bondholders is making him a favorite among emerging-market investors.While concerns remain over alleged human right abuses and his obsession with Bitcoin — which he adopted as an official currency in 2021 — Bukele has assuaged the bond market’s worst fears by engineering two debt buybacks, hiring a former International Monetary Fund veteran as an adviser and repaying $800 million of bonds.Read more: El Salvador’s Iron Fist on Crime Hurts Democracy: Eduardo PorterStory continuesThe extra yield investors demand to hold Salvadoran sovereign bonds over similar US Treasuries has more than halved in the past year. Notes maturing in 2035 and thereafter are trading below the 10 percentage-point threshold to be considered distressed.The country’s bond performances compares to a 6.6% average return across an index of developing nations.“The story continues to be positive on the fiscal accounts and Bukele has continued to be very consistent in signaling to bondholders that he’s serious about paying the debt,” said Zulfi Ali, a portfolio manager at PGIM.Besides JPMorgan, Eaton Vance and PGIM, Lord Abbett & Co LLC, Neuberger Berman Group LLC and UBS Group AG have added the debt since April, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.“El Salvador has benefited from proactive and prudent management of its balance sheet, including a debt buyback during the second half of 2022 and material pension reform,” said Mila Skulkina, a money manager at Lord Abbett.For Shamaila Khan, head of emerging markets and Asia Pacific at UBS Asset Management Americas Inc., the market was overpricing the risk of future defaults.“The policy mix was a lot more favorable and it implied that the default risks in the coming months and possibly years are not as high as what was priced into the market,” Khan said.Read more: Hedge Fund Bets There’s Value in El Salvador After 180% Bond RunStill, for some investors, El Salvador remains a high-risk trade, especially starting in 2027 when the nation faces a large maturity wall. The government doesn’t have much freedom in its financing plan and may have difficulty navigating if the market turns more negative on risk assets, said Katrina Butt, a senior economist at AllianceBernstein in New York.Notes maturing in 2027, 2029 and 2032 are still trading at distressed levels.Due to the medium- and long-term risks, Claudia Calich, the head of emerging-market debt at M&G Investments, has stayed neutral on the credit.Even if the country manages to pull through the next couple of years, it faces a series of issues including limited dollar reserves and questions over whether it can access global capital markets.“Eventually we’d need to talk about not only a situation about liquidity but we’d also need to address good policy making,” Calich said. “Ultimately, the country will need to start relying on external markets again.”--With assistance from Maria Elena Vizcaino and Carolina Wilson.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: Awakened by howling winds that tore through his Maui neighborhood, Shane Treu went out at dawn and saw a wooden power pole suddenly snap with a flash, its sparking, popping line falling to the dry grass below and quickly igniting a row of flames.He called 911 and then turned on Facebook video to livestream his attempt to fight the blaze in Lahaina, including wetting down his property with a garden hose.“I heard ‘buzz, buzz,’” the 49-year-old resort worker recounted to The Associated Press. “It was almost like somebody lit a firework. It just ran straight up the hill to a bigger pile of grass and then, with that high wind, that fire was blazing.”Treu’s video and others captured the early moments of what would become the deadliest U.S. wildfire in more than a century. Now the footage has emerged as key evidence pointing to fallen utility lines as the possible cause. Hawaiian Electric Co. faces criticism for not shutting off the power amid high wind warnings and keeping it on even as dozens of poles began to topple.A class-action lawsuit has already been filed seeking to hold the company responsible for the deaths of at least 99 people. The suit cites the utility’s own documents showing it was aware that preemptive power shutoffs such as those used in California were an effective strategy to prevent wildfires but never adopted them.“Nobody likes to turn the power off — it’s inconvenient — but any utility that has significant wildfire risk, especially wind-driven wildfire risk, needs to do it and needs to have a plan in place,” said Michael Wara, a wildfire expert who is director of the Climate and Energy Policy Program at Stanford University. “In this case, the utility did not.”“It may turn out that there are other causes of this fire, and the utility lines are not the main cause,” Wara said. “But if they are, boy, this didn’t need to happen.”Hawaiian Electric declined to comment on the accusations in the lawsuit or whether is has ever shut down power before due to high winds. But President and CEO Shelee Kimura noted at a news conference Monday that many factors go into that decision, including the possible effect on people who rely on specialized medical equipment and firefighters who need power to pump water.Story continues“Even in places where this has been used, it is controversial, and it’s not universally accepted,” she said.Maui Police Chief John Pelletier also expressed frustration at the news conference that people were complaining both that power was not cut off earlier and too many people were unaccounted for because of a lack of cell and internet service.“Do you want notifications or do you want the power shut off?” he said. “You don’t get it both ways.”Mikal Watts, one of the lawyers behind the lawsuit, told the AP this week that he was in Maui, interviewing witnesses and “collecting contemporaneously filmed videos.”“There is credible evidence, captured on video, that at least one of the power line ignition sources occurred when trees fell into a Hawaiian Electric power line,” said Watts, who confirmed he was referring to Treu’s footage.Treu recorded three videos to Facebook on Aug. 8 starting at 6:40 a.m., three minutes after authorities say they received the first report of the fire. Holding a hose in one hand and his phone in the other, he streamed live as the first police cruisers arrived and can be heard warning officers not to cross the live power lines laying in the road.At one point, he zooms the camera in on a cable dangling in a charred patch of grass, surrounded by orange flames.Treu’s neighbor, Robert Arconado, also recorded videos that he provided to the AP. Arconado’s footage, which starts at 6:48 a.m., shows a lone firefighter headed toward the flames as they continued to spread west downhill and downwind along Lahainaluna Road, toward the center of town.By 9 a.m., Maui officials declared the fire “100% contained,” and the firefighters left. But about 2 p.m., Arconado said the same area had reignited.A video he filmed at 3:06 p.m. shows smoke and embers being carried toward town as howling winds continued to lash the island. Arconado continued to film for hours, as towering pillars of flame and smoke billowed from the neighborhoods downhill, forcing people to jump into the ocean to escape.“It was scary, so scary,” Arconado said. “There was nowhere to go. … I witnessed every single thing. I never go to sleep.”Treu’s and Arconado’s homes were spared, but satellite imagery reviewed by the AP shows that starting about 500 yards downwind whole neighborhoods were reduced to ash. Though experts say the early evidence suggests multiple blazes may have been ignited in and around Lahaina on Aug. 8, there were no recorded lightning strikes or other apparent natural causes for the fires.Robert Marshall, CEO of Whisker Labs, a company that collects and analyzes electrical grid data, said sensors installed throughout Maui to detect sparking power lines showed a dangerously high number of such live wire incidents that night and into the following morning. The sensors, 70 in all, record breaks in electric transmission after trees fall on power lines or other accidents, and they showed dozens of such faults in areas where fires likely broke out and around the time the blazes probably started.The faults, which Marshall likened to a series of circuit breakers tripping at the same time, were remarkable for the amount of power lost, a third of the usual 120 volts coursing through lines. Marshall said he couldn’t say whether any of the sparks resulted in a fire, only noting that there were many opportunities for it to happen.“A substantial amount of energy was discharged,” said Marshall, pointing to a graph on his computer screen with several lines plunging at the same time. “Any one of these faults could have caused a wildfire, any could have been an ignition source.”After the 2018 Camp Fire in northern California killed 85 people in a disaster caused by downed power lines, Pacific Gas & Electric paid $13.5 million to settle legal claims. State regulators adopted new procedures requiring utilities to turn off the electricity when forecasters predict high winds and dry conditions that might cause a fire to spread.In Maui, the National Weather Service first began alerting the public about dangerous fire conditions on Aug. 3. Forecasters issued a “red flag warning” on Aug. 7, alerting that the combination of high winds and drought conditions would create ideal conditions for fire.Even though Hawaiian Electric officials specifically cited the Camp Fire and California’s power shutoff plan as examples in planning documents and funding requests to state regulators, on the day of the Maui fire there was no procedure in place for turning off the island’s grid.Wara said the video posted by Treu also raised questions about Hawaiian Electric’s assertion that it had disabled an automatic recharge mechanism that turns electricity back on after a failure because it appeared that the downed wire Treu recorded was still live.Hawaii Attorney General Anne Lopez announced last week that she opened “a comprehensive review of critical decision-making and standing policies leading up to, during and after the wildfires.”Hawaiian Electric’s Kimura said the company had started its own investigation. Its shares have plummeted by more than 40% over the past week on fears the company may have to pay big damages. The stock price tumbled another 20% in Tuesday afternoon trading.Watts, one of the lawyers suing the company, said the fire that destroyed Lahaina was predictable, given the weather and fuel conditions. He said Hawaiian Electric documents show the company knew its grid on Maui was degraded after decades of neglect. Old power poles were supposed to be replaced between 2019 and this year, but he alleges the company delayed the work.“That is why the town of Lahaina is decimated, thousands are now homeless and hundreds will mourn the loss of their innocent loved ones,” he said. “This is an unprecedented tragedy that was an entirely preventable tragedy.”Jennifer Potter, who lives in Lahaina and until the end of last year was a member of the Hawaii Public Utilities Commission, confirmed that many of Maui's wooden power poles were in poor condition.“Even tourists that drive around the island are like, ‘What is that?’ They’re leaning quite significantly because the winds over time literally just pushed them over. And in many cases they weren’t replaced,” she said. “That obviously is not going to withstand 60, 70 mph winds.”Potter said a comprehensive wildfire mitigation plan should have been established years ago, including removing vegetation from around the power lines and instituting procedures for power shutoff, with backup generation for first responders and those who rely on medical devices.“There’s more that could have been done. Now we have 20/20 hindsight. But really we need to be focusing on what changes need to be made throughout the state moving forward,” she said. “This just doesn’t need to happen anymore.”___Biesecker reported from Washington, Condon from New York and McDermott from Providence, Rhode Island.___Contact AP’s global investigative team at Investigative@ap.org.

Text Content: By Tom HalsWILMINGTON, Delaware (Reuters) - AMC Entertainment Inc was hit with a class-action lawsuit on behalf of preferred shareholders that are challenging its stock conversion plan, just days after the cinema operator ended a bruising legal fight with a different group of investors.AMC got court approval on Friday for a settlement of a class action lawsuit by holders of the company's common stock, clearing the way for the company to convert its preferred stock, known as APEs, to common shares.AMC, a "meme" stock that was part of a social media-fueled trading frenzy in 2021 along with other companies such as Gamestop, has said that conversion plan is key to strengthening its finances.A holder of APEs said in the lawsuit, which was filed late on Monday but hit the public docket on Tuesday, that APEs investors are being shortchanged in the settlement that was approved on Friday.AMC did not respond to a request for comment.AMC agreed to settle the class action by holders of common stock by providing them with additional shares worth an estimated $129 million. The holders of common stock had claimed that the company rigged a shareholder vote against them.In the new lawsuit filed in Delaware's Court of Chancery, APE investor Michael Simons claims AMC is obligated to provide the same amount of new stock to APE holders as the company is giving to common shareholders in the settlement.Simons' complaint said the settlement "has the effect of diluting the preferred shareholders’ ownership interest in AMC." He also said it violates the certificate of designation that governs AMC's preferred stock.The lawsuit adds to months of legal turmoil for the company. Objections to shareholder class action settlements are rare, but AMC received thousands from investors who questioned claims about the company's dire finances. The settlement was initially rejected by a Court of Chancery judge in July before the judge signed off on a revised deal on Friday.(Reporting by Tom Hals in Wilmington, Delaware; Editing by Josie Kao)

Text Content: By Pratik JainAug 15 (Reuters) - Medical equipment maker Agilent Technologies cut annual profit and sales forecasts for a second straight quarter as demand stays soft in major market China due to a slow economic recovery.Agilent expects full-year revenue to be between $6.80 billion and $6.85 billion, compared with $6.93 billion to $7.03 billion projected earlier.It expects annual adjusted profit per share between $5.40 and $5.43, compared with its prior forecast of $5.60 to $5.65."In July, we saw a further (sales) deterioration in China, resulting in the 17% decline for the quarter," CFO Robert McMahon said in a post-earnings call."While the Q3 decline in China was centered in pharma, which was down 30%, we did see weakness in other end markets as well. We expect the conditions we've seen in July to persist in China for Q4."For the third quarter ended July 31, the company's total sales fell 2.7% to $1.67 billion.Sales from its third-largest segment that offers genetic sequencing, contract manufacturing, research and development, among others, were $349 million, missing a Refinitiv estimate of $355.67 million.The sales miss was due to softness in genomics and the shutdown of its Resolution Bioscience business, which offered next-generation sequencing-based cancer diagnostics solutions.The company said on Tuesday it has taken a $291 million pre-tax charge in the quarter associated with the shutdown and expects the wind-down to continue through the fourth quarter and into early fiscal 2024.Agilent CEO Mike McMullen flagged performance of its largest unit that provides laboratory instruments, consumables and software continues to be affected by the market environment in China."Our sales funnel remains healthy and are up year-on-year, but deal velocity continues to slow as customers remain cautious in making capital purchases," McMullen added.Its quarterly adjusted profit per share was $1.43, above expectations of $1.36.

Apollo and other senior lenders had offered to provide the company $142.5 million in new money to fund the trucking firm’s wind-down, but Yellow was approached with less expensive options after filing Chapter 11.Apollo and other existing Yellow lenders won’t proceed with their proposed Chapter 11 loan as a result of the Citadel deal, the person said. A Yellow lawyer said last week it is considering alternative bankruptcy loans from hedge fund MFN Partners LP, the company’s largest shareholder, and rival trucking company Estes Express Lines.A Citadel spokesman declined to comment. Lawyers representing Citadel Credit Master Fund LLC filed court papers Tuesday in Yellow’s bankruptcy. A representative for Apollo declined to comment.The Financial Times first reported that Citadel acquired Yellow debt owned by Apollo and other lenders.Yellow has said the alternative bankruptcy loans its considering are less expensive and will give the company more time to sell its valuable real estate portfolio and vast fleet of trucks and trailers. The Chapter 11 loan offered by funds managed by Apollo and other existing lenders carried 17% interest and higher fees.The case is Yellow Corp. 23-11069, US Bankruptcy Court District of Delaware (Wilmington).©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Source: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-buying-most-iranian-oil-210000668.html
Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Chinese imports of sanctioned Iranian oil are running at the highest level in at least a decade as rising global prices make the discounted crude more attractive, according to data intelligence firm Kpler.Iran has been ramping up oil exports this year as it becomes more geopolitically assertive, with most of the shipments heading to China. The easing of a probe by Beijing into imports of bitumen mixture, which Iranian crude is sometimes disguised as, also appears to be speeding the passage of cargoes through customs, according to traders who are involved in the market.The world’s biggest oil importer will take about 1.5 million barrels a day of crude from Iran this month, according to an estimate from Kpler. That compares with an average of 917,000 barrels a day in the first seven months of the year and would be the highest in the Kpler figures that go back to 2013.A jump of around a fifth in global benchmark Brent crude since late June is raising demand for the cut-price oil, much of which is bought by independent refiners clustered in Shandong province. Iran’s two main grades are currently trading at discounts of more than $10 a barrel to Brent, traders said, and are considerably cheaper than Russian varieties.“The higher flat prices go, the better risk-reward ratio for Shandong refiners to look for Iranian crude,” said Homayoun Falakshahi, a senior oil analyst at Kpler. The oil is often classified as coming from Malaysia in Chinese government data and can be sometimes reported as diluted bitumen mixture if it’s mixed with heavier Venezuelan crude, he said.The independent refiners, or teapots, often disguise Iranian crude as feedstocks such as bitumen mixture to avoid using up their oil import quota.Story continuesThe government launched an investigation into imports of the feedstock in Shandong in April, which had been holding up flows of heavier crudes from Iran and Venezuela. The reasons for the probe are still unclear, but it’s recently been eased, according to traders.Meanwhile, Vortexa Ltd., another company that monitors flows of oil into China, said it sees the country taking about 1 million barrels a day of Iranian crude this month, compared with a record 1.3 million barrels in December. The contrasting estimates from the tanker-tracking firms may be due to different methods in analyzing the flows.“Crude import quotas and uncertainty on non-crude import standards are holding China’s imports in August in check,” said Emma Li, an analyst at Vortexa. Some of the increase in Iranian oil exports may also go into floating storage, she said.The industry relies on figures from companies like Kpler and Vortexa as purchases of Iranian oil typically aren’t included in the Chinese customs data, which doesn’t show any imports since June 2022.Iranian crude is often classified as diluted bitumen mixture and, more recently, “other heavy oil.” Imports of other heavy oil surged by around 88 times in June from May, while purchases of bitumen mixture quadrupled, according to the customs data. Malaysia is the biggest supplier of both categories.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: (Reuters) -Construction materials maker Fletcher Building said on Wednesday its annual profit nearly halved and warned of a decline in overall sales in fiscal 2024 as rapid interest rate hikes impacted housing demand and prices.Shares of the New Zealand-based company fell 4% to NZ$5.27 in early trading, the lowest level since June 29, after the company also declared a lower final dividend of 16 New Zealand cents per share compared with 22 cents a year earlier."A rapid increase in interest rates resulted in a material drop in buyer demand and an average circa 15% reduction in house prices," the country's largest construction materials maker said, adding that higher materials and labour costs further compressed its margins.With interest rates anticipated to remain at high levels in the near term, Fletcher expects to see further tightening in its overall sales volumes in fiscal 2024.It logged a net profit after tax of NZ$235 million ($139.87 million) for the year ended June 30, down from NZ$432 million a year earlier, mainly as it set aside NZ$255 million to cover rising costs from the construction of a convention centre in Auckland.Analysts on average had estimated NZ$318.7 million in net profit, according to Refinitiv data.($1 = 1.6801 New Zealand dollars)(Reporting by Poonam Behura and Sameer Manekar in Bengaluru; Editing by Shilpi Majumdar and Shinjini Ganguli)

Text Content: (Adds U.S. senator's comments)HONG KONG, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Law firms in China are scrambling to comply with Beijing's new guidance to tone down the language used to describe China-related business risks in companies' offshore listing documents, five people familiar with the matter said.The moves come after China's securities regulator last month in a closed-door meeting asked domestic law firms to refrain from including negative descriptions of China's policies or its business and legal environment in the IPO prospectuses.A failure to do so could mean their listings are not able to get a regulatory nod, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) warned, Reuters had first reported, citing people with knowledge of the matter.The law firms are now racing to change the wordings in some already submitted listing prospectuses and applications yet to be filed, said the five sources, who declined to be identified due to sensitivity of the matter.Some potential issuers, which have yet to be given the green light from the CSRC, were earlier this month asked by the regulator to tweak the risk factors in their prospectuses to comply with the new offshore listing rules, said one of the sources.China's new listing rules, which came into effect in March, stipulate that any "distortion or misinterpretation" on China's laws and policy, business environment, and judiciary was prohibited.All major markets require listing aspirants to disclose to prospective investors risks related to the companies themselves, their business sectors, and the countries where they are headquartered in their offering prospectuses.Beijing's demand for companies to tone down China business-related risks comes amid the country's stuttering economy, heightened geopolitical tensions and the government's sharpened focus on national security.As part of the changes demanded by the regulator, lawyers are replacing descriptions of "COVID lockdown measures" in IPO applications with "the COVID-19 pandemic" to avoid references to harsh and controversial travel and business curbs during the pandemic, said the second source.Story continuesAlso, instead of mentioning "foreign exchange control" in some IPO applications, local lawyers in China are proposing to use more neutral phrasing such as "foreign exchange management", the source added.Prospective Chinese equity issuers in offshore markets, including the United States, are required to file to the CSRC days after they submit listing applications offshore and need China's green light to proceed with their fundraisings.Some of the offshore IPO prospectuses, in which the changes on China risk disclosures are being made, are yet to be filed with the CSRC, the sources said.The CSRC did not respond to Reuters' faxed request for comment.RISK DISCLOSURESSince the CSRC's meeting with law firms late last month, at least two IPO applications have tweaked the ways they describe how China makes policy changes, said the first source and a third person.Those documents now say Chinese policies and regulations can be amended or adjusted from time to time, the two sources said, a marked shift in tone from previous wording that said the government and other local authorities can order rule changes randomly or without prior notice.Other changes include removing a statement that entails the enforcement of arbitral awards in China is difficult, the first source said, adding, lawyers have instead put a description that China's judicial system is different from other jurisdictions.For one prospective Hong Kong listing, lawyers have removed references to uncertainties around China's regulatory, political and economic environments and foreign exchange control in the prospectus, according to a fourth source.In revised listing application rules that came into effect on Aug 1, Hong Kong's bourse removed a section on China risks previously required specifically for mainland-incorporated companies, a move it said would align disclosure rules for all IPO-aspirants.In response to Reuters' request for comment, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange said on Tuesday that all listing applicants from all jurisdictions are required under Hong Kong's listing rules to disclose all material risks, including jurisdictional risks."There has been no change to this requirement."Four of the sources said the toning down on China business-related risks in the domestic companies' offshore listing applications could trigger queries from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has warned companies of insufficient China-risk disclosures."This is the latest evidence that China is manipulating financial information to hide serious risks and to deceive American investors," U.S. Senator Marco Rubio told Reuters in a statement on Tuesday."We cannot allow Chinese companies to benefit from our capital markets while ignoring our rules...(SEC) Chairman Gensler needs to take action to protect American retirees and investors from these deceptive Chinese firms," he added.The SEC did not immediately comment on Rubio's comments.(Reporting by Selena Li, Julie Zhu, Kane Wu, and Xie Yu in

Text Content: SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Almost a week after the Apple faithful collectively gasped at the first evidence that the iPhone’s red “end call” button might soon be vacating its center position to take up residence one column to the right, it looks like it might have been mostly a false alarm.The initial shock followed the release of last week's test, or beta, version of iOS 17, the next major update of the iPhone’s operating software. That's where users first saw the end-call button, which has traditionally lived in splendid isolation centered well below function buttons such as “mute,” “keypad” and “speaker,” instead joining its peers and taking a more assimilated position in the lower right-hand corner of a six-button block.Now, though, images of the latest iOS 17 beta shared by multiple media sites shows the red button right back in the center of the phone dialpad, pretty close to where it’s long staked out its territory. But it's still not alone; now it's in the second row, center seat of that six button block, where it appears to be daring you to try hanging up without also opening the keypad or accidentally adding another participant to your call.To be fair, it's always difficult to draw firm conclusions from beta software releases, which are intended both to help engineers hunt down bugs and to gauge user reaction to changes large and small. So they're a bit experimental by nature, and some experiments fare better than others.But we don't have much choice but to speculate whether the end-call button's wanderings have come to an end. Apple typically doesn't comment on its design process — or much of anything else — and did not reply to a request for comment from The Associated Press.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- The yen may have slumped to within a whisker of levels that saw Japan intervene in the currency market last year, but options traders see little need to prepare for a jolt from authorities in Tokyo.One-week implied volatility in dollar-yen, a gauge of expected movement in the currency pair over the period, is drifting slightly higher but remains close to the lowest level this year.That signals option traders see little likelihood of intervention even if the yen weakens to 145.90 — which saw authorities wade in last September — or the view that Japan entering the market wouldn’t be too disruptive. It traded at 145.60 at 7:43 a.m. in Tokyo Wednesday.While Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki said Tuesday that he’s watching market trends with a “sense of urgency,” traders and government officials appear to see the speed of movements as more important triggers than specific levels.“Suzuki’s verbal intervention is at level four out of seven on our verbal intervention scale,” said David Forrester, a senior FX strategist at Credit Agricole CIB in Singapore, adding that seven indicates actual intervention is imminent. “Implied volatility would pick up if verbal intervention were to become more forceful and if Suzuki said FX movements are ‘clearly one-sided, excessive and/or not reflecting fundamentals’.”Read more: A Trader’s Guide to Japanese Policymakers’ Language on the YenBank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda surprised many investors last month in a post-policy meeting press conference by saying that foreign exchange volatility had been a factor in the BOJ’s decision to adjust its monetary program. The policy tweak effectively lifts the cap on 10-year bond yields to 1% from 0.5%.Story continuesYet while higher yields would typically be expected to support the currency, the yen has continued to depreciate and this week touched the weakest in nine months amid a persistently wide interest-rate gap between the US and Japan.Even if the Ministry of Finance decides to intervene in the market, which it does by directing the BOJ to buy and sell currencies, there is no guarantee that it would stem the slide.After initially rallying following intervention in September last year, the yen weakened further, as far as 151.95 per dollar, which spurred two more interventions in October before the trend started to change. The three interventions cost about 9 trillion yen, or about $62 billion at the current exchange rate.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Ask anyone to name a typical characteristic exhibited by Bitcoin and they might mention that it’s volatile. But it turns out that of late, the most popular digital token has been anything but.Gauges that measure the price swings of the original cryptocurrency, which is trading at around $29,000, have been trending down — 90-day volatility is at its lowest since 2016, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Meanwhile, three-month implied volatility sits at 35, according to researcher K33. For comparison, consider what happened in October 2020: it hit a then-all-time-low of 56, after having gone 47 days without a 5% move.“The deafening silence from the market throughout the summer of 2023 has pushed implied volatilities well below former all-time lows,” wrote the firm’s Bendik Schei and Vetle Lunde.It’s an unusual stretch of calm for the token, which has over the years garnered attention for its wild price swings. In the past, it’s not been abnormal for it to see 5% or 10% swings one day that are then reversed the next session.That’s why its recent lassitude hasn’t gone unnoticed, and any number of other volatility measures show similar listlessness.Bitcoin has been “trading within a historically low-volatility regime, with several metrics indicating extreme apathy and exhaustion,” according to analysts at Glassnode. For one, they refer to what’s known as upper and lower Bollinger Bands, which are right now separated by just 2.9%. A tighter spread’s only been seen on two prior occasions.While the price action was a bit more exciting in June — when BlackRock Inc. shocked markets after filing for a spot-Bitcoin ETF — things have calmed down since. Bitcoin has hovered around $29,000 every trading session in August so far, data compiled by Bloomberg shows.Story continuesSecular narratives around Bitcoin, such as it disrupting traditional finance, can be thought of as being longer-term drivers, says Kara Murphy, CIO at Kestra Investment Management. “But then in the near-term, there are periods during which Bitcoin is a very high-risk call option on free money,” she said.“What we’ve seen is that now that the Fed rate-tightening cycle is over, that long-term secular story is becoming more important and Bitcoin’s become a little bit more boring, because that secular story doesn’t necessarily change from day to day.”©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: (Repeats for early Asia readership. No change to text.)HONG KONG, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Law firms in China are scrambling to comply with Beijing's new guidance to tone down the language used to describe China-related business risks in companies' offshore listing documents, five people familiar with the matter said.The moves come after China's securities regulator last month in a closed-door meeting asked domestic law firms to refrain from including negative descriptions of China's policies or its business and legal environment in the IPO prospectuses.A failure to do so could mean their listings are not able to get a regulatory nod, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) warned, Reuters had first reported, citing people with knowledge of the matter.The law firms are now racing to change the wordings in some already submitted listing prospectuses and applications yet to be filed, said the five sources, who declined to be identified due to sensitivity of the matter.Some potential issuers, which have yet to be given the green light from the CSRC, were earlier this month asked by the regulator to tweak the risk factors in their prospectuses to comply with the new offshore listing rules, said one of the sources.China's new listing rules, which came into effect in March, stipulate that any "distortion or misinterpretation" on China's laws and policy, business environment, and judiciary was prohibited.All major markets require listing aspirants to disclose to prospective investors risks related to the companies themselves, their business sectors, and the countries where they are headquartered in their offering prospectuses.Beijing's demand for companies to tone down China business-related risks comes amid the country's stuttering economy, heightened geopolitical tensions and the government's sharpened focus on national security.As part of the changes demanded by the regulator, lawyers are replacing descriptions of "COVID lockdown measures" in IPO applications with "the COVID-19 pandemic" to avoid references to harsh and controversial travel and business curbs during the pandemic, said the second source.Story continuesAlso, instead of mentioning "foreign exchange control" in some IPO applications, local lawyers in China are proposing to use more neutral phrasing such as "foreign exchange management", the source added.Prospective Chinese equity issuers in offshore markets, including the United States, are required to file to the CSRC days after they submit listing applications offshore and need China's green light to proceed with their fundraisings.Some of the offshore IPO prospectuses, in which the changes on China risk disclosures are being made, are yet to be filed with the CSRC, the sources said.The CSRC did not respond to Reuters' faxed request for comment.RISK DISCLOSURESSince the CSRC's meeting with law firms late last month, at least two IPO applications have tweaked the ways they describe how China makes policy changes, said the first source and a third person.Those documents now say Chinese policies and regulations can be amended or adjusted from time to time, the two sources said, a marked shift in tone from previous wording that said the government and other local authorities can order rule changes randomly or without prior notice.Other changes include removing a statement that entails the enforcement of arbitral awards in China is difficult, the first source said, adding, lawyers have instead put a description that China's judicial system is different from other jurisdictions.For one prospective Hong Kong listing, lawyers have removed references to uncertainties around China's regulatory, political and economic environments and foreign exchange control in the prospectus, according to a fourth source.In revised listing application rules that came into effect on Aug 1, Hong Kong's bourse removed a section on China risks previously required specifically for mainland-incorporated companies, a move it said would align disclosure rules for all IPO-aspirants.In response to Reuters' request for comment, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange said on Tuesday that all listing applicants from all jurisdictions are required under Hong Kong's listing rules to disclose all material risks, including jurisdictional risks."There has been no change to this requirement."Four of the sources said the toning down on China business-related risks in the domestic companies' offshore listing applications could trigger queries from the U.S. regulator, which has warned companies of insufficient China-risk disclosures.(Reporting by Selena Li, Julie Zhu, Kane Wu, and Xie Yu in Hong Kong.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Global investors including BlackRock Inc. and Allianz SE may be key stakeholders to watch in Country Garden Holdings Co.’s debt crisis given their recent exposure to the embattled Chinese property developer’s dollar bonds.BlackRock held $351.9 million of Country Garden dollar bonds, according to a filing dated Aug. 11. Allianz’s position was $301 million based on a June 30 filing. That was also when filings from others including Fidelity International Ltd. and HSBC Holdings Plc showed they were holders.According to filings dated April 30 and March 31 respectively, Ninety One UK Ltd. and Apollo Asset Management Inc. also held the developer’s notes.Other banks with exposure to Country Garden’s dollar notes included UBS Group AG and JPMorgan Chase & Co., based on their filings earlier this month. Deutsche Bank AG and Banque Lombard Odier & Cie SA also had positions, according to their filings in late June.The filings don’t necessarily reflect current holdings as some might have changed since the documents were filed, and firms may hold bonds on behalf of clients. Rules on how funds disclose their holdings vary by country.BlackRock, HSBC, Allianz, Fidelity, Ninety One, UBS, JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank and Banque Lombard Odier either declined to comment or didn’t immediately offer comment. Apollo has yet to respond to requests for comment.Country Garden, formerly China’s biggest developer by contracted sales before a deal slump this year, is at risk of its maiden bond default. The countdown has begun for a 30-day grace period after it missed coupon payments effectively due Aug. 7 on two dollar notes.Story continuesNonpayment would send tremors through China’s debt markets as offshore creditors often rank lower than domestic peers in restructuring. How a potential debt overhaul pans out is pivotal to broader confidence in China’s crisis-ridden property sector, where efforts to sort out debt claims and better protect investors tend to be protracted processes.Fidelity International, a major holder of Chinese builders’ junk bonds, pared about 7% of its holdings between July 4 and Aug. 3, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.Country Garden has more than 3,000 housing projects in the country, four times those of China Evergrande Group, which until now has been the epicenter of an unprecedented cash crunch among developers.In the latest sign of its debt struggles, Country Garden is soliciting feedback on a proposal to extend payment for a 3.9 billion yuan ($535 million) local note originally due Sept. 2 with amortized disbursements over 36 months.The developer said last week it planned to hold bondholder meetings in the near future regarding repayment arrangements. The firm reiterated it will take measures to defuse risks and protect the legitimate rights of its investors while ensuring home deliveries.--With assistance from Lorretta Chen.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Japan’s interest rates have been grounded for 30 years. Now one bank is seeking people with 1980s-era experience akin to aviator Pete “Maverick” Mitchell to navigate their take-off.While it may be a stretch to liken regional banking to the dogfighting of Tom Cruise’s Top Gun character, that’s exactly how Tatsuya Kataoka describes his bank’s challenges in anticipation of borrowing costs finally rising in coming years.“Rates have been falling since the 1990s,” said Kataoka, 56, who joined Concordia Financial Group Ltd. in 1990 and became its president last year. “There are very few who experienced rising rates, not just at our bank, but probably at others.”Like many in the market, Kataoka doesn’t expect the Bank of Japan’s negative-rate policy to end in the immediate future, but he said he needs to be ahead when the eventuality comes. “Whether financial institutions can prepare before rates start rising determines the winners and losers five years down the road.”Talent is one of the biggest management challenges, according to Kataoka. Concordia, which owns Bank of Yokohama Ltd. and is one of Japan’s biggest regional lenders, has been hiring people and nurturing young employees through trainee programs to beef up its markets operations and help to manage its 3 trillion yen ($21 billion) securities portfolio.“Those who know the markets of the 1980s and early 90s, who were in the dealing room when rates were rising, are becoming fewer. We need to have such veterans as advisers,” he said. “But to be honest, we haven’t been able to find any.”Asked whether he meant someone like the main character in Top Gun: Maverick, Kataoka said “Yes, you can say that. Someone who can fly the fighter manually,” referring to the scene in which Maverick commandeered an old F-14 Tomcat fighter.Story continuesRead how old-school JGB voice brokers are coming backIn the 1980s, the yield on the 10-year JGBs ranged from about 2.5% to 7%, making it essential to have nimble and highly skilled traders. More recently, the BOJ’s monetary easing has kept the benchmark below 1% for over a decade, and most traders have never experienced a major surge in rates that would put them at risk of large writedowns.Kataoka’s bank has already learned a hard lesson on what can happen when you go into a rate-rising phase unprepared. Concordia is one of many Japanese lenders that were caught off guard by the US Federal Reserve’s rapid rate hikes last year, which forced them to dump foreign bonds at a loss. Some US regional lenders fared even worse, with Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic Bank among those to fail.Kataoka said the bank has tightened its risk management. His bank got rid of loss-making foreign bonds and is set to rebuild its securities holdings. “Market volatility is high, so we are now discussing what our portfolio should be right now,” he said.Read about what helped Japan banks withstand SVB scareThe bank is “very cautiously” building up collateralized loan obligations and other foreign debt products, he said. Its CLO holdings stood at about 170 billion yen at the end of June, up from 150 billion yen three months earlier.Kataoka said the bank is paying close attention to credit risks of these products. “We are investing within the scope of manageable risks,” he said.Concordia is also gradually increasing Japanese government bonds that are held to maturity and relatively short-term ones in the available-for-sale portfolio, as yields tick higher.“We need to be careful about the speed and timing of the build-up” in holdings, Kataoka said, referring to the BOJ’s surprise tweak to its yield curve control program in July.The impact of the BOJ’s interest-rate policy isn’t limited to the bank’s securities portfolio. Its traditional loan and deposit businesses are also likely to see major shifts.The introduction of the negative-rate policy seven years ago has made deposits less attractive for Japanese banks. Besides squeezing the spread between what they receive on loans and pay on deposits, it meant they have to pay to hold excess reserves at the central bank. The opposite will happen if rates start climbing.“If interest-rate conditions begin to change, the scale of deposits and assets will become very important,” Kataoka said.--With assistance from Brett Miller and Issei Hazama.(Updates with CLO holdings in the 11th paragraph)©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: By Tetsushi KajimotoTOKYO (Reuters) - Big Japanese manufacturers and service-sector firms signalled improved business morale in August, a monthly Reuters poll showed on Wednesday, reflecting a gradual economic recovery from COVID-induced doldrums despite an uncertain global outlook.Their indexes rose to plus 12 and plus 32, respectively, in August, from plus 3 and plus 23 in the previous month, according to the Reuters Tankan survey, which is strongly correlated with the Bank of Japan's key quarterly tankan.The strong results came on the heels of government gross domestic product (GDP} data out on Tuesday that showed much stronger-than-expected growth for the second quarter in the world's third-largest economy, driven by solid car exports.However, many firms were wary about the outlook, particularly over slowing growth in China, Japan's largest trading partner."Declines in demand for chip-related business and softening of Chinese markets for auto-parts and environment-related products are continuing," wrote a manager of an industrial ceramic maker."Orders for production goods are declining due to slump in demand for capital expenditures amid China's economic slowdown," according to a machinery maker's manager.The Reuters poll of about 500 large companies, of which roughly half responded, also recorded that many firms are struggling to pass on elevated costs of raw materials.The service-sector index fared much better , with the non-manufacturers index rising 9 points to +32, posting the first increase in three months.The Reuters poll, conducted from Aug. 1-11, found corporate confidence was expected to continue rising over the coming three months, with manufacturers' sentiment seen at +14. The service sector sentiment is somewhat seen down at +26.The Reuters Tankan indexes, which can serve as leading indicators for the Bank of Japan tankan surveys, are calculated by subtracting the percentage of pessimistic respondents from optimistic ones. A positive figure means optimists outnumber pessimists. Respondents reply on condition of anonymity.(Reporting by Tetsushi Kajimoto; Editing by Devika Syamnath)

The company is backed by Vietnam’s richest man, who added tens of billions of dollars to his net worth with VinFast’s first-day gains.The listing caps VinFast’s years-long efforts to become a publicly traded company and puts it in the same arena as Tesla Inc., Lucid Group Inc. and Rivian Automotive Inc. A listed status may also pave the way for VinFast to raise more capital as it looks to expand in the US.Read More: EV Maker VinFast to List on Nasdaq in Rare SPAC Venue SwitchVinFast Chief Executive Officer Le Thuy said the listing isn’t a publicity stunt to introduce the still-niche brand to American car buyers, but rather a necessary step in expanding beyond its home country.“It’s just a milestone that we want to achieve on a path to becoming a global company,” she told Bloomberg Television in an interview.The Southeast Asian carmaker — one of the few Vietnamese firms to list in the US — broke ground on its North Carolina factory last month. The plant is expected to have an initial capacity of 150,000 vehicles a year, and the company plans to begin production in 2025.Story continuesVinFast has gotten off to a shaky start in the US. In May, the company recalled all the electric sport utility vehicles it had shipped to the country over a software defect. It’s expecting more operating and net losses in the near term as it scales vehicle production.While EV makers have a particularly patchy record when it comes to blank-check mergers, VinFast is optimistic about its equity appraisal for the SPAC listing.

Reuters also saw a similar delay in tests it ran.By late Tuesday afternoon, X appeared to have eliminated the delay. When contacted for comment, X confirmed the delay was removed but did not elaborate.Billionaire Elon Musk, who bought Twitter in October, has previously lashed out at news organizations and journalists who have reported critically on his companies, which include Tesla and SpaceX. Twitter has previously prevented users from posting links to competing social media platforms.Reuters could not establish the precise time when X began delaying links to some websites.A user on Hacker News, a tech forum, posted about the delay earlier on Tuesday and wrote that X began delaying links to the New York Times on Aug. 4. On that day, Musk criticized the publication's coverage of South Africa and accused it of supporting calls for genocide. Reuters has no evidence that the two events are related.A spokesperson for the New York Times said it has not received an explanation from X about the link delay."While we don't know the rationale behind the application of this time delay, we would be concerned by targeted pressure applied to any news organization for unclear reasons," the spokesperson said on Tuesday.A Reuters spokesperson said: "We are aware of the report in the Washington Post of a delay in opening links to Reuters stories on X. We are looking into the matter."Bluesky, an X rival that has Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey on its board, did not reply to a request for comment.Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.(Reporting by Sheila Dang in Dallas; Editing by Kenneth Li and Deepa Babington)

Text Content: (Repeats to additional subscribers)By Carolina MandlNEW YORK, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Global hedge funds are "aggressively" selling Chinese stocks amid heightened concerns over the country's property sector and a weak batch of economic data, a Goldman Sachs report on Tuesday showed.All types of stocks were sold, but A-shares, those listed in the domestic stock market, led the sell-off, comprising 60% of it, the bank said."Hedge funds have net sold Chinese stocks in eight of the last ten sessions on the prime book through 8/14," it said, adding its clients divested both their long and short positions.This is the largest net selling in Chinese equities over any 10-day period since Oct 2022 and one the highest moves in the past five years.Goldman Sachs, as one of the biggest providers of lending and trading services through its prime brokerage unit to investors, is able to track hedge funds' investment trends.Global investors have raised concerns about China's economy as a confluence of recent events has darkened its economic outlook.On Tuesday, a broad array of Chinese economic data highlighted intensifying pressure on the economy from multiple fronts, prompting Beijing to cut key policy rates to shore up activity.Chinese property giant Country Garden is seeking to delay payment on a private onshore bond and a major Chinese trust company that traditionally had sizable exposure to real estate, Zhongrong International Trust Co, has missed some repayment obligations.Hedge funds are increasingly wary of their exposure to China. A raft of U.S.-based hedge funds, including Coatue, D1 Capital and Tiger Global, cut their positions in Chinese stocks in the second quarter, as the country's economic prospects already seemed to wobble and geopolitical tension increased, securities filings showed on Monday.(Reporting by Carolina Mandl in New York; Editing by Sonali Paul)

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- TCW Group promoted a new cohort of leaders as the $210 billion asset manager embarks on an expansion in alternatives under Chief Executive Officer Katie Koch.The firm is seeking to build on its roots as a public fixed-income manager and broaden its offerings in alternative credit, including private credit, collateralized loan obligations and private securitized credit.“The next decade of fixed income is going to look really different from the last couple of decades,” Koch, 43, said in an interview Tuesday. “There’s more going private in the fixed-income space.”Laird Landmann, a generalist portfolio manager and co-directer of fixed income, will retire at year-end after almost four decades at the Los Angeles-based firm, according to a letter sent to clients.Steve Kane, co-chief investment officer and also a generalist portfolio manager, as well as co-director of fixed income, will remain with the firm until at least the end of 2024. He’ll serve as co-CIO and co-director for fixed income until year-end and will then be a generalist until he retires, the letter said.Jerry Cudzil and Ruben Hovhannisyan were promoted to generalist portfolio managers alongside Bryan Whalen, helping to oversee more than $180 billion of fixed-income assets. Peter Van Gelderen was hired as co-head of the securitized group alongside Liza Crawford, the firm said in a statement Monday.Koch took over as CEO this year after a 20-year career at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.Brian Gelfand was named co-head of global credit and head of credit trading, assuming Cudzil’s former role, according to the letter. Steve Purdy becomes co-portfolio manager of the unconstrained bond fund, which makes distressed investments.Story continuesThe Wall Street Journal reported some of the promotions earlier.The firm is also focused on reinvigorating its existing investment platforms with new fund structures, as well as expanding its presence outside of the US, Koch said. TCW recently struck a deal with activist investor Engine No. 1. to acquire its exchange-traded funds unit, Koch’s first deal as CEO.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: (Repeats earlier item, no change to text)HONG KONG, Aug 15 (Reuters) - China's economic activity data for July, including retail sales, industrial output and investment failed to match expectations, fuelling concern over a deeper, longer-lasting slowdown in growth.THE DEMISE OF CHINA'S GROWTH HAS BEEN MISTAKENLY FORECAST BEFORE. IS THIS TIME DIFFERENT?Activity data has been missing forecasts since the beginning of the second quarter, with the weakness raising worries that China's economy is coming closer to a crunch point.It would not be for the first time.Alarm bells over growth rang during the global financial crisis in 2008-09 and during a capital outflow scare in 2015. China came out of those with a shock boost to infrastructure investment and by encouraging property market speculation, among other measures.But infrastructure upgrades have created too much debt, and the property bubble has already burst, posing risks to financial stability.Given China's debt-fuelled investment in infrastructure and property has peaked, and as exports are slowing in line with the global economy, China only has one other source of demand to tinker with: household consumption.In that sense, this slowdown is different.Whether China bounces back largely depends on whether it can convince households to spend more and save less, and whether they will do so to such an extent that consumer demand compensates for weaknesses elsewhere in the economy.WHY ARE ECONOMISTS FOCUSING ON HOUSEHOLD DEMAND?Unlike consumers in the West, Chinese people were left largely to fend for themselves during the COVID-19 pandemic and the revenge spending spree that some economists expected after China re-opened never took place.But household consumption, as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP), was among the lowest in the world even before COVID, with economists identifying it as a key structural imbalance in an economy relying too heavily on debt-fuelled investment.Story continuesEconomists blame weak domestic demand for subdued investment appetite in the private sector and for China sliding into deflation in July. If it persists, deflation could exacerbate the economic slowdown and deepen debt problems.The imbalance between consumption and investment is deeper than Japan's before it entered its "lost decade" of stagnation in the 1990s.HOW BAD CAN THE SLOWDOWN GET?The July activity data has prompted some economists to flag risks that China may struggle to meet its growth target of about 5% for the year without more fiscal stimulus.That is still much higher growth than many other major economies will see, but for one that invests roughly 40% of its GDP every year - about twice as much as the United States invests - it remains a disappointing result.There is also uncertainty about China's appetite for large fiscal stimulus, given the high levels of municipal debt.Stress in the property market, which accounts for about a quarter of economic activity, raises further concern about the ability of policymakers to arrest the decline in growth.Some economists warn that investors will have to get used to much lower growth. A minority of them even raise the prospect of Japan-like stagnation.But other economists say many consumers and small businesses may already feel economic pain as deep as during a recession, given youth unemployment rates above 21% and deflationary pressures weighing on profit margins.WILL INTEREST RATE CUTS HELP?China's central bank surprised markets by cutting interest rates on Tuesday.But economists warn the cuts are too small to make a meaningful difference, their primary role being to send a signal to markets that authorities are ready to stimulate the economy.Deeper cuts may also create risks of yuan depreciation and capital outflows, which China will be keen to avoid.WHAT WOULD HELP?Economists want to see measures that would boost the household consumption share of the GDP.Options include government-funded consumer vouchers, significant tax cuts, encouraging faster wage growth, building a social safety net with higher pensions, unemployment benefits and better, and more widely available, public services.No such steps have been flagged at a recent Communist Party leadership meeting, but economists are looking to a key party conference in December for more profound structural reforms.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Nova Labs Inc., a blockchain startup building what it calls a “decentralized wireless network”, said it’s offering a phone plan that costs $5 a month for unlimited text, talk and data. The plan will initially only be available for Miami residents or people who receive an invite to access the product, Nova Labs said in a statement on Tuesday. The startup was founded in 2013 with a focus on the “internet of things” with efforts to develop a decentralized wireless network for devices like pet-tracking collars and environmental sensors. Nova Labs pivoted to crypto in 2018, introducing rewards to users in the form of branded tokens. The company, which changed its name from Helium Inc., has previously come under fire for saying Salesforce Inc. and electric scooter company Lime were using its wireless network services when they were not. In 2022, Nova Labs raised $200 million at a $1.2 billion valuation from investors led by Tiger Global Management and Andreessen Horowitz and has raised more than $250 million from venture capital firms to date, according to data from PitchBook.Its latest offering will be powered by 5G hotspots owned by individuals and businesses. People who sign up will be able to connect to the hotspots with mobile devices, including iPhones and Androids, using the Helium Network. The company says there are more than 7,000 hotspots throughout the US.The telecom industry has struggled with customer service issues and pricing wars, allowing for competitors to step in and sell unlimited plans that cost $20 a month, which is less than half the average cost of those offered offered by major national networks—T-Mobile, for example, offers a $40-a-month unlimited plan. Still, these plans have had trouble gaining traction. “This is a completely different economic model for building wireless networks,” Nova Labs Chief Executive Officer Amir Haleem said. “There’s generally this feeling of discontent with telecom companies, whether it’s home broadband, or whether it’s cell phones.”Story continuesWith the Helium Network, homeowners and businesses can purchase the Helium hotspots for prices ranging from about $1,500 to $7,000, Haleem said. Nova Labs will provide the hotspot owners with 50 cents worth of crypto tokens for each gigabyte of data their hotspots provide to customers. Nova Labs isn’t alone in attempting to combine telecommunications with one or more elements of crypto and the blockchain. In 2018, a company called Sirin Labs developed a blockchain smartphone that is still available for sale and explored a partnership with Huawei Technologies Ltd. that never came to fruition. Solana Labs, a blockchain developer that also has a partnership with Nova Labs, introduced a mobile phone in May, and last week slashed the price of the device to $599 from $1,000.Nova says that when phones with the Helium Mobile plan are out of range of a hotspot, they’ll switch to the wireless network managed by T-Mobile, the second-largest US carrier. Nova partnered with T-Mobile last year to launch what it described as “a crypto-powered mobile service.” The token associated with that launch was trading at $0.00032469 on Tuesday with 24-hour volumes of less than $75,000, according to CoinGecko data.Even though the Helium Network provides better “economics” to customers than T-Mobile, according to Haleem, its wireless services partner is still essential. “We’re not deluding ourselves into thinking that the network is usable at the moment entirely — it’s still too small and too spotty, and too patchy,” Haleem said.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: A Florida judge should rule without trial against Disney as the company fights Gov. Ron DeSantis’ takeover of a board that oversees Walt Disney World, the Republican governor's appointees said in a Tuesday court filing.Members of the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District asked the state judge in Orlando for a summary judgment that would rule in their favor on five of the nine counts in their case.The case is one of two lawsuits stemming from the takeover, which was retaliation for Disney’s public opposition to the “Don’t Say Gay” legislation championed by DeSantis and Republican lawmakers. In the other lawsuit, in federal court in Tallahassee, Disney says DeSantis violated the company’s free speech rights.DeSantis isn't a party in the state court case in which his appointees accuse Disney of wrongly stripping them of powers over design and construction at Disney World when the company made agreements with Disney-friendly predecessors. The DeSantis appointees argued that the board of Disney supporters didn't give proper notice, lacked authority and unlawfully delegated government authority to a private entity.The judge in the state case last month refused Disney's request to dismiss the lawsuit.The fight between DeSantis and Disney began last year after the company, facing significant pressure internally and externally, publicly opposed a state law banning classroom lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity in early grades, a policy critics call “Don’t Say Gay.”As punishment, DeSantis took over the district through legislation passed by Florida lawmakers and appointed a new board of supervisors to oversee municipal services for the sprawling theme parks and hotels. But the new supervisors' authority was limited by the company's agreements with predecessors.In response, DeSantis and Florida lawmakers passed legislation that repealed those agreements.The governor has touted his yearlong feud with Disney in his run for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination, often accusing the entertainment giant of being too “woke.” Disney has accused the governor of violating its First Amendment rights.Story continuesIn an interview with CNBC on Monday, DeSantis urged Disney to drop the company's lawsuit, saying that he and his allies have moved on from the feud with the company.“They’re suing the state of Florida. They’re going to lose that lawsuit,” DeSantis said on CNBC’s “Last Call.”___Follow Mike Schneider on Twitter at @MikeSchneiderAP

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- China’s lapse into deflation is fueling jitters across financial markets but money managers say it isn’t necessarily a bad thing.Falling prices in the world’s second-largest economy are likely to translate into lower costs across the globe given China’s status as the factory of the world, according to EdenTree Investment Management and Gama Asset Management SA. Easing inflation will allow central banks to refrain from further interest-rate hikes, and possibly pivot to an easing, to shore up slowing growth.The prospect of slower global price pressures may be one of the few upsides of China’s descent into deflation as the economy struggles to regain its footing after a post-Covid bounce faded. Inflation is likely to remain muted as a property slump and troubles in the shadow banking industry curb spending and investments by both consumers and companies.“A weak China might bring forward the peak in monetary tightening,” said Christopher Hiorns, portfolio manager at EdenTree Investment. “It would also reduce demand for commodities which would reduce inflation pressures and may allow Western economies to run ‘hotter.’”Inflation in the US and other countries has quickened in the years after the pandemic, cutting consumers’ purchasing power and forcing central banks to jack up interest rates. China’s predicament is different, owing to a variety of circumstances including a prolonged property slump that has hurt confidence and dented spending. The price of Chinese goods at US docks has dropped every month in 2023.Read: Why Deflation Could Become a Welcomed Chinese Export: Next ChinaStory continues“The positive angle is that China’s slight deflation and slow growth will dampen inflation in the rest of the world even faster,” said Rajeev De Mello, a global macro portfolio manager at Gama Asset Management. However, a slowing China will also lead to a slowdown in Asia and Europe, he added.De Mello told Bloomberg Television on Tuesday that China’s export of deflation is positive for global bondholders and emerging-market assets.To be sure, the impact of Chinese deflation on the world’s largest consumer, the US, and other trading partners may be minor and transitory. The US’ purchases of China goods has decreased, and the war in Ukraine is driving up the price of commodities such oil.What Bloomberg economists say:On the current trajectory, a cushioned decline in China’s growth will have limited impact on the US economy or the Federal Reserve’s calculus. In a downside scenario, where China under-delivers on stimulus and growth spirals down, a shift to risk-off sentiment and tighter global credit conditions could tip the Fed into rate cuts sooner than expected.Read more here.In addition, any further stimulus from Chinese authorities may help arrest the economic downturn and put a floor under prices. The People’s Bank of China unexpectedly reduced a key interest rate by the most since 2020 on Tuesday, reflecting the growing concern about the worsening outlook.“The weakness of the Chinese economy and the apparent deflation are a clear dampener of global inflation,” said Gary Dugan, chief investment officer at Dalma Capital Management Ltd. “However, we don’t believe the Chinese authorities will sit back and just accept the current malaise.”--With assistance from James Mayger and Marcus Wong.(Adds Bloomberg economist comment)©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: By Casey HallSHANGHAI, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Shanghai driver Zhu Zhimin works 15 hours a day to earn the same money he was making only a few months ago working a regular shift, as he competes with an increasing number of Chinese rushing into the ride-hailing industry.Zhu, who takes home 400-600 yuan ($55-$82) a day ferrying passengers from early morning to late at night, says he wasn't able to take a day off for three months earlier this year."I go back at midnight, I take a shower and then go to bed. I have no spare time," he said from behind the wheel. "My children are getting older, my parents are getting older, so my family needs money."China's weak post-pandemic recovery and record youth unemployment are sending more people into the ride-hailing sector, flooding the market and eroding the incomes of many of the 5.8 million drivers registered for such apps.On Tuesday, a raft of data highlighted how the world's second largest economy had slowed further in July, putting pressure on already faltering growth.About 400,000 people began driving for ride-hailing firms in China between the end of April and the end of July, state media said, citing Ministry of Transport data.Analysts see this more than 7 percent increase in the number of drivers as a manifestation of the subdued job market. Average income for employees in Shanghai is around 525 yuan a day, data from the city government shows, in line with what most drivers make working much longer hours than an office worker."The downturn of the socio-economic environment led to a reduction in job opportunities and an influx of labour into the ride-hailing industry," said Wang Ke, an automotive and travel industry analyst at Analysys, a market research firm."An increasing number of unemployed individuals make the ride-hailing industry their first choice."China has more than 300 ride-hailing apps, which accounted for over 40% of total taxi trips last year, state media reported.Story continuesCities including Shanghai, Sanya and Changsha have suspended issuing new ride-hailing permits. At least four others have issued warnings of overcapacity, with some saying drivers get fewer than 10 orders a day as a result."Because the economy is not doing well, many workers have been laid off and began ride-hailing," said James Cai, 33, from Haikou, the capital of Hainan island and one of the cities warning of too many drivers. "Most of them are 20-30 year olds."Cai said he earns 200-300 yuan a day, driving for Didi Global - China's answer to Uber - from 8.00 am until close to midnight. Up until recently, he made 400 yuan a day plus bonuses, going home before 8.00 pm."This job is not working out," he added.Didi did not respond to emailed questions about driver numbers, pay and the latest curbs in some cities.'SELF-CORRECTION'Wang, from Analysys, expects a market "self-correction" as some drivers drop out.Nanxun Li, another Haikou driver, sold his car last month and quit a job he had been doing for 10 years, after his income dropped to 300-400 yuan a day from 1,000 when he first started."It's getting difficult to make ends meet," Li said.But even with less drivers, making a living is likely to become more difficult for many people as China enters an era of much slower economic growth, economists say.More than 21% of Chinese youth were unemployed as of June. China's statistics bureau said on Tuesday it will stop releasing jobless youth data, drawing public ire.Shanghai driver Li Weimin's rationale for working underscores the shrinking job market."I don’t eat during the day, and I only have one meal after I get home at night," said the 45-year-old, who drives from 6.30 am to 1 am to take home around 500 yuan."But I must persist, because there is no other job."($1 = 7.2761 Chinese yuan renminbi) (Reporting by Casey Hall and Xihao Jiang in Shanghai and the Beijing and Shanghai newsrooms; editing by Marius Zaharia and Miral Fahmy)

Text Content: By Nausheen Thusoo and Lewis JacksonSYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's Dexus on Wednesday swung to its first net loss since 2009 as higher interest rates wiped nearly A$1.2 billion ($773.16 million) off the value of its property portfolio, in a fresh blow for the troubled real estate sector.The property industry globally, and office building owners in particular, are struggling as home working and e-commerce lead tenants to reconsider floor space just as higher interest rates reduce building values and raise debt servicing costs.Dexus, one of Australia's largest office landlords, delivered a net loss of A$752.7 million for the year ended June 30, down from a A$1.62 billion profit a year earlier.The loss was driven by a A$1.18 billion valuation downgrade across its A$17.4 billion property portfolio, predominantly in the office sector, where values fell by 8.8%.Adjusted funds from operations (AFFO), which excludes valuation changes and one-off charges, were A$555 million, down 3% from a year earlier.Shares fell 4% at the open before rallying slightly to be down 2.8% after the first half hour."Operating in an uncertain economic environment remains challenging," Dexus CEO Darren Steinberg said in a statement. "In this environment we have continued to diversify our capital sources, and grow and diversify our funds management business, while we re-weight the Dexus portfolio."Occupancy across Dexus' portfolio of 62 office properties was 95.9%. Roughly a third of tenancy renewals last financial year added floor space, versus 9% of those contracting, the company said.Dexus continued to raise equity over the past financial year, reporting A$1.6 billion in third-party equity commitments and an oversubscribed new airport investment vehicle.The company secured A$2.6 billion in new financing, including a A$500 million exchangeable note issue. Pro-forma gearing was 27.9%, below its 30% to 40% target range.Story continues"Dexus has operationally outperformed the market from their higher quality portfolio, however investors will remain cautious of global office fundamentals," Citi analysts said in a note.Dexus forecast a slightly lower AFFO in fiscal 2024, driven by a fall in trading profits.($1 = 1.5521 Australian dollars)(Reporting by Nausheen Thusoo in Bengaluru and Lewis Jackson in Sydney; Editing by Shilpi Majumdar and Jamie Freed)

It is now at its lowest level since November 2018.Whole milk prices also fell 10.9% to an average selling price of $2,548 a metric ton - their lowest level since 2016."Dairy market conditions have deteriorated, and prices have fallen sharply," said Bank of New Zealand senior economist Doug Steel."Ongoing economic challenges in China and generally softer Chinese yuan were not helping purchasing power. Moreover, there is more Chinese domestic milk supply, onshore milk powder production, and higher inventory levels, so there is no need for the Chinese to chase imported product," he added.The increase in product was not helping, with dairy product volumes up 3% on the prior auction to a total of 33,580 tons, the auction platform said.Falling dairy prices are a concern for the New Zealand economy as the dairy sector generates more than 7% of the nation's gross domestic product and the country is already in a technical recession.ASB Bank economist Nathaniel Keall said in a note that while milk supply is forecast to tighten in the latter half of the farming year, ASB does not expect it will be enough to buoy the market until after much of this year's product has been priced.GDT Events is owned by New Zealand's Fonterra Co-operative Group Ltd, but operates independently from the dairy giant.U.S.-listed CRA International Inc CRAI.O is the trading manager for the Global Dairy Trade auction, which is held twice a month, with the next scheduled for Sept. 5.

Text Content: (Adds further detail from central bank from paragraph 4)By Lucy CraymerWELLINGTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - New Zealand's central bank held the cash rate steady at 5.5% on Wednesday, as it reiterated that its previous rate hikes had helped constrain spending and inflation pressures as anticipated.The decision was in line with expectations from 29 economists in a Reuters poll all forecasting the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) would leave the cash rate at a 14-year high for the second consecutive meeting."The committee agreed that the OCR (official cash rate) needs to stay at restrictive levels for the foreseeable future to ensure annual consumer price inflation returns to the 1% to 3% target range," the statement said.It said that conditional on its central economic outlook, the cash rate will need to remain at around its current level for slightly longer than was assumed in its May statement in order for the monetary policy committee to meet its inflation and employment objectives.The RBNZ continues to forecast the official cash rate (OCR) to peak at its current level of 5.5% with some upside risk of another hike, but now does not expect to cut until the first half of 2025, according to the monetary policy review (MPR) accompanying the rate decision.A front-runner in withdrawing pandemic-era stimulus among its peers, the RBNZ has battled to curb inflation, lifting rates by 525 basis points since October 2021 in the most aggressive tightening since the official cash rate was introduced in 1999.The rate hikes have sharply slowed the economy, now in a technical recession following two quarters of negative growth.

Text Content: *New home prices fell in monthly and annual terms in July*More cities reported a fall in new home prices(Adds details, background)BEIJING, Aug 16 (Reuters) - China's new home prices fell for the first time this year in July, official data showed on Wednesday, as piecemeal policy support failed to shore up the embattled property sector, heaping pressure on authorities to introduce bolder stimulus.The 0.2% fall month-on-month came after June's flat reading, according to Reuters calculations based on National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data. Prices were down 0.1% from a year earlier, after a flat result in June.The decline in home prices comes amid a worsening debt crisis at major developers, sliding property investment and home sales. Taken together with the broader softening of economic growth and weak consumer confidence, the latest data underlines the continued pressure faced by policymakers to ramp up their support measures.China's property sector, which accounts for a quarter of its economic activity, continues to struggle despite an extension of financial support for developers and incentives for first-time home buyers and upgraders.Among 70 cities, 49 saw a fall in new home prices month-on-month in July from 38 cities the previous month.The Politburo, a top decision-making body of the ruling Communist Party, in July vowed to adjust property policies in response to significant market changes.The central bank on Tuesday unexpectedly cut key policy rates for the second time in three months to support the faltering economic recovery.As part of efforts to restore confidence, the central bank earlier this month vowed to guide banks to adjust interest rates on existing mortgages.Some cities have already relaxed a handful of property curbs in efforts to shore up sentiment. More such announcements are expected in the coming weeks, but the investor response has so far been tepid, highlighting the depth of China's economic underperformace this year.

Text Content: (Adds U.S. Steel statement in paragraphs 5-6)By David CarnevaliNEW YORK, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Esmark Inc majority owner and chief executive James Bouchard said in an interview on Tuesday that his steelmaker, which does not publicly report its earnings, has cash for its $7.8 billion bid for U.S. Steel Corp sitting in his bank account.Esmark unveiled its offer on Monday after Cleveland-Cliffs Inc, another steelmaker, said on Sunday it had made a $7.3 billion offer for U.S. Steel, which the latter rejected. Cleveland-Cliffs said it could afford the deal because it would pay for half of it using its own stock as currency and borrow from banks to help pay for the other half.Bouchard said he had $10 billion available and Esmark itself had no debt. "I got $10 billion in cash in my bank account," Bouchard said. He did not provide more details to verify he has access to the cash.Bouchard added he was being advised on his offer for U.S. Steel by an "international bank" he declined to name, which was also willing to lend to him.A spokesperson for U.S. Steel said Esmark could pursue it by participating in a process it announced on Sunday for exploring a potential deal with interested parties."This is the first that we have heard from Esmark. We welcome them to join the multiple parties already in our previously announced strategic alternatives process," the U.S. Steel spokesperson said.Bouchard, a former U.S. Steel executive, said Esmark was "the third largest steelmaker in the country", without elaborating with any figures.In 2008, he sold another company of his with the same name to Russian steelmaker OAO Severstal for $1.3 billion. He subsequently bought back the Esmark name, trademark and intellectual property to create his latest steelmaker, which he says generates over $500 million in annual revenue.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- The People’s Bank of China moved to boost market sentiment with a stronger-than-expected yuan fixing and its largest injection of short-term cash to the financial system since February.The central bank injected 297 billion yuan ($40.7 billion) of short-term liquidity Wednesday. That came right after it set a much stronger-than-expected daily reference rate for the managed currency.The yuan is on the brink of dropping to a 16-year low against the dollar following the central bank’s unexpected interest-rate cut Tuesday. With the Federal Reserve still tightening policy to tame inflation, the yield gap between 10-year US and Chinese government bonds is at the widest since 2007. That’s helping fuel outflows as local investors look for higher yields overseas.“China’s monetary policymakers have a balancing act to execute: supporting a domestic economy through lower interest rates without causing capital outflows,” said David Chao, a global market strategist for Asia Pacific ex-Japan at Invesco Asset Management in Singapore.With slowing growth in consumer spending, industrial output and investment, the rate cut suggests policymakers are growing increasing concerned about the deteriorating outlook. Another major property developer now faces a debt crisis and home sales continue to decline. Contagion worries are also spreading to the financial sector.The PBOC is tasked with keeping the currency stable while aiming to boost the economy — two ambitions that can often be in conflict. A weak yuan may damp the appeal of China assets to overseas investors, while Chinese firms may be reluctant to convert foreign currencies into yuan given the yield differential.Story continuesBearish sentiment toward the yuan has intensified in the options market, with one-month dollar-yuan implied volatility offshore hovering around the highest since April. The onshore yuan also traded closer to the weak end of its trading limit defined by the daily reference rate. These are further signs that if any policy actions to support the yuan aren’t delivered quickly, bearish wagers could be buoyed further.Traders betting against the yuan will also be on alert for further dollar sales by state-owned banks to help prop up the currency. Other tools in reserve includes selling dollars, or adding punitive costs to shorting yuan in forward markets.(Updates top with yuan fixing and cash injection.)©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Zhongrong International Trust Co. missed payments on dozens of products and has no immediate plan to make clients whole, indicating troubles at the embattled Chinese shadow bank are deeper than previously known.Wang Qiang, board secretary of the firm partly owned by financial giant Zhongzhi Enterprise Group Co., told investors in a meeting earlier this week that the firm missed payments on a batch of products on Aug. 8, adding to delays on at least 10 others since late July, according people familiar with the matter. At least 30 products are now overdue and Zhongrong also halted redemptions on some short-term instruments, one of the people said.The company doesn’t have an immediate plan to cover the payments since its short-term liquidity has suddenly dried up, Wang said. He added that the number of products with missed payments has risen and the company is facing a “tsunami” of questions from investors and their own wealth managers, according to the people familiar, who asked not to be identified because the meeting was private. Wang asked for patience as the firm seeks to recoup the value of its investments.The increased delays signal that the troubles at Zhongzhi, which manages $138 billion, are deeper than initially thought as only three clients so far have publicly revealed missing payments by the two firms. Chinese authorities have already set up a task force to study any possible contagion, with the banking regulator examining risks at Zhongzhi, people familiar with the matter said earlier.Zhongrong didn’t respond to requests for a comment.The liquidity challenges underscore how troubles in the property sector, and China’s weakening economy, are now spreading deeper into to the financial sector. Many trust products are backed by real estate projects run by troubled developers such as China Evergrande Group.Story continuesZhongrong is among the biggest firms in the country’s $2.9 trillion trust industry, which pools savings from wealthy households and corporate clients to make loans and invest in real estate, stocks, bonds and commodities. The firm has 270 high-yield products totaling 39.5 billion yuan ($5.4 billion) due this year, according to data provider Use Trust.Read more: CHINA INSIGHT: 3 Trillion Reasons Trust Industry Shock Not OverWang dismissed online rumors that it has stopped making payments on all its products.Liquidity has dried up “unexpectedly,” making it hard to meet short-term debt obligations as most of the underlying assets are long-term and illiquid, he said. The products bear some resemblance to a “funding pool,” he said, referring to a previously widespread practice where proceeds from new products are used to pay other investors. This method was banned by regulators a few years ago.Zhongrong is now seeking to limit the fallout from the defaults and ensure the stability of its operations, which can in turn help with repayments, Wang said.Zhongzhi is among private wealth managers that Beijing has been trying to rein in for years to minimize risks for the hundreds of thousands of retail clients who buy these products assuming they’re safe. China is already struggling with a weak economy and fallout from the property slump that’s threatening to push giants like Country Garden Holdings Co. into default. The central bank on Tuesday cut interest rates by the most in three years in a bid to revive growth.Read more: Why Missed Payments at China Trust Firm Jolted Market: QuickTakeAccording to Bloomberg Economics, the trust sector’s exposure to real estate is about 2.2 trillion yuan, or 10% of total assets as of the end of 2022. Zhongrong is the ninth-biggest trust, with about 600 billion yuan in assets.“The big danger is that a negative feedback loop kicks in, with property stress causing strains in the financial system, undermining credit expansion and depressing growth, which, in turn, exacerbates the slump in the property sector,” Bloomberg Economics said in a note.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

The Hang Seng Index slid more than 1%, inching closer to a technical bear market.Pressure is building across China’s financial markets given a slew of disappointing economic data, renewed concerns about the property sector and an unfolding crisis in the nation’s shadow banking system. That’s calling for more aggressive easing by Beijing as investors say the incremental policies so far have failed to revive confidence.READ: Xi Faces More Tough Choices After Surprise China Rate CutMarket reaction to a spate of stimulus steps has been muted, underscoring the extent of investor pessimism. On Tuesday, the People’s Bank of China cut a benchmark interest rate in a surprise move to shore up sentiment, while policymakers are considering cutting the stamp duty on stock trades for the first time since 2008. Still, they have so far refrained from helping out the heavily indebted property sector and giving consumers more cash to spend.The outlook for China’s economic growth is dimming, with investment banks around the world cutting their 2023 forecasts. JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s team lowered its full-year projection to 4.8%.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Woodside Energy Group Ltd. and officials representing workers at some of its liquefied natural gas facilities failed to reach agreement on issues that could trigger strikes, increasing the threat of disruptions to global exports.Discussions on Tuesday over demands around pay and other conditions by staff at the North West Shelf LNG operations in Western Australia failed to reach any consensus, the Offshore Alliance, which includes two key labor unions, said in a Facebook post on Wednesday.“Woodside are well off the pace on key bargaining issues including job security and remuneration,” the alliance said. The producer’s “actions and bargaining position at yesterday’s meeting will determine the destiny of our bargaining campaign.”A spokesperson for Woodside didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Outages at the Woodside operation and at Chevron Corp. sites, where workers are also considering industrial action, could put about 10% of global LNG supply in jeopardy, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.While Europe rarely buys Australian LNG, it would need to compete with other countries in Asia for replacement shipments. The Dutch benchmark is still more than 80% below the records reached last year in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.Story continuesChevron will delay plans to sell some spot market cargoes from its Gorgon operation as a result of the strike risks, people familiar with the details said Tuesday. The producer declined to comment on the sales, and on details on any planned talks with union leaders.About 150 Woodside workers voted for potential action that would include stoppages of between 30 minutes and fours hours, and actions such as refusing to unload cargo other than food, water or medical supplies. They would also stop restarting process gas compressors or generators, and wouldn’t facilitate helicopter landings.Workers at Chevron’s Gorgon and Wheatstone downstream facilities must complete a separate vote on action by Aug. 24, while Australia’s Fair Work Commission on Monday authorized union officials to ballot members at the Wheatstone offshore platform. Votes need to be completed no later than 10 days after a ballot order is made.Industrial action must start within 30 days of a completed ballot, unless the commission grants a request for an extension. A union needs to give seven days’ notice before that industrial action begins.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Oil steadied after a two-day decline as industry estimates pointed to lower US inventories, potentially adding to signs of a tighter market.West Texas Intermediate was little changed near $81 a barrel after losing 2.6% in the week’s first two sessions. The American Petroleum Institute said nationwide crude stockpiles shrank by 6.2 million barrels last week, according to people familiar with the figures. Inventories at the key Cushing, Oklahoma, storage hub were also seen declining to the lowest level since April.Oil has backtracked this week following a surge driven by supply cuts from OPEC+ linchpins Saudi Arabia and Russia, and estimates that worldwide crude consumption is running at a record pace. The decline has come amid disappointing economic data from top importer China, with banks cutting growth estimates as the nation’s gargantuan real estate sector flounders.The US dollar’s recent advance has also been a headwind for commodities, with a Bloomberg gauge of the greenback set for a fifth straight session of gains. That’s making raw materials more expensive for most overseas buyers.Timespreads have narrowed in tandem with crude benchmarks in recent sessions. The gap between WTI’s two nearest contracts was 50 cents a barrel in backwardation compared with last week’s intraday peak of 76 cents a barrel. The backwardated structure, however, still implies near-term tightness.To get Bloomberg’s Energy Daily newsletter direct into your inbox, click here.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: By Rae WeeSINGAPORE (Reuters) - The yen languished near its weakest level in nine months on Wednesday and kept traders on alert for any signs of intervention, while mounting concerns over China's sputtering economy and gloomy outlook soured the mood in Asia.The offshore yuan struggled to break away from a nine-month low hit in the previous session, having slid to that level after a slew of Chinese data on Tuesday undershot forecasts, and prompted Beijing to deliver unexpected cuts to its key policy rates.It was last little changed at 7.3240 per dollar.The China gloom saw the Australian and New Zealand dollars, often used as liquid proxies for the yuan, tumbling to their lowest levels since November in early Asia trade.The Aussie bottomed at $0.6440, while the kiwi slid to a low of $0.5939, ahead of a rate decision by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand later on Wednesday."The People's Bank of China has led the way in delivering what little easing has materialised thus far, but much more needs to be done," said Aninda Mitra, head of Asia macro and investment strategy at BNY Mellon Investment Management."Pressure is now piling up on policymakers to act sooner, and in a bigger way. The weakening trend in Chinese activity is not entirely unexpected. But surprises to the downside, even amidst a downbeat consensus, places the onus on policy makers to walk the talk."Elsewhere, a sliding yen also kept traders on the lookout for any intervention from Japan, with the currency having crossed the closely-watched 145 per dollar level for four sessions now, a zone which triggered heavy dollar selling by Japanese authorities in September and October of last year.Policymakers have not been as vociferous as they have been last year in their rhetoric against defending a weakening yen, with Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki saying on Tuesday that authorities are not targeting absolute currency levels for intervention.Story continues"If we get up towards 150, I think it becomes increasingly likely (for an intervention)," said Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at National Australia Bank. "But where we are at the moment, I think the jawboning will continue but I'm not convinced that we'll see intervention."In the broader currency market, the dollar was on the front foot after U.S. retail sales surpassed expectations in July, underscoring the economic resilience and strengthening the case for the Federal Reserve to keep rates higher for longer.That sent the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield jumping to its highest since October at 4.2740% on Tuesday. It last stood at 4.2110%.The two-year Treasury yield similarly rose to an over one-month peak of 5.0240% in the previous session and was last at 4.9437%.The greenback predictably rode Treasury yields higher, with the dollar index ekeing out a slight gain to 103.22.The euro was little changed at $1.0902, while sterling dipped 0.05% to $1.2696, ahead of UK inflation data due later on Wednesday.(Reporting by Rae Wee; Editing by Shri Navaratnam)

Text Content: By Rae WeeSINGAPORE, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The yen languished near its weakest level in nine months on Wednesday and kept traders on alert for any signs of intervention, while mounting concerns over China's sputtering economy and gloomy outlook soured the mood in Asia.The offshore yuan struggled to break away from a nine-month low hit in the previous session, having slid to that level after a slew of Chinese data on Tuesday undershot forecasts, and prompted Beijing to deliver unexpected cuts to its key policy rates.It was last little changed at 7.3240 per dollar.The China gloom saw the Australian and New Zealand dollars, often used as liquid proxies for the yuan, tumbling to their lowest levels since November in early Asia trade.The Aussie bottomed at $0.6440, while the kiwi slid to a low of $0.5939, ahead of a rate decision by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand later on Wednesday."The People's Bank of China has led the way in delivering what little easing has materialised thus far, but much more needs to be done," said Aninda Mitra, head of Asia macro and investment strategy at BNY Mellon Investment Management."Pressure is now piling up on policymakers to act sooner, and in a bigger way. The weakening trend in Chinese activity is not entirely unexpected. But surprises to the downside, even amidst a downbeat consensus, places the onus on policy makers to walk the talk."Elsewhere, a sliding yen also kept traders on the lookout for any intervention from Japan, with the currency having crossed the closely-watched 145 per dollar level for four sessions now, a zone which triggered heavy dollar selling by Japanese authorities in September and October of last year.Policymakers have not been as vociferous as they have been last year in their rhetoric against defending a weakening yen, with Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki saying on Tuesday that authorities are not targeting absolute currency levels for intervention.Story continues"If we get up towards 150, I think it becomes increasingly likely (for an intervention)," said Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at National Australia Bank. "But where we are at the moment, I think the jawboning will continue but I'm not convinced that we'll see intervention."In the broader currency market, the dollar was on the front foot after U.S. retail sales surpassed expectations in July, underscoring the economic resilience and strengthening the case for the Federal Reserve to keep rates higher for longer.That sent the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield jumping to its highest since October at 4.2740% on Tuesday. It last stood at 4.2110%.The two-year Treasury yield similarly rose to an over one-month peak of 5.0240% in the previous session and was last at 4.9437%.The greenback predictably rode Treasury yields higher, with the dollar index ekeing out a slight gain to 103.22.The euro was little changed at $1.0902, while sterling dipped 0.05% to $1.2696, ahead of UK inflation data due later on Wednesday.(Reporting by Rae Wee Editing by Shri Navaratnam)

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Sea Ltd. fell its most ever after reporting disappointing revenue and outlining plans to increase investment in e-commerce, a strategic shift that could erode margins and trigger a price war with TikTok and Alibaba.The stock plunged 29% in New York after Sea reported that sales grew a lower-than-expected 5.2% in the second quarter, when it pulled back on shopping promotions and gaming revenue plunged 41%. Chief Executive Officer Forrest Li said the company intends to expand Sea’s online shopping arm, Shopee, and that “such investments will have impact on our bottom line and may result in losses.”It’s a notable shift for Sea, which in previous quarters pledged to focus on profitability over the pursuit of growth. But competition from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s Lazada, coupled with new entrants such as ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok, is piling pressure on Shopee, once Southeast Asia’s online shopping leader. Alibaba grew its international commerce business 41% in the June quarter, while TikTok is expanding aggressively into key markets like Indonesia.“There is a lack of visibility on the investment’s effectiveness,” Citigroup analyst Alicia Yap said in a note, downgrading the stock to neutral from buy. “A brutal battle could be just starting.”Li’s comments about spending spooked investors long accustomed to watching price-based competition wipe out margins. Singapore-based Sea last year embarked on an aggressive cost-cutting drive to reverse years of losses, pivoting to a focus on the bottom-line as revenue growth decelerated from the triple-digit percentage rates of just two years ago. The company froze salaries and slashed hundreds of millions of dollars in sales and marketing expenses to achieve positive cash flows.Story continuesThe company, the largest of Southeast Asia’s internet firms and briefly the world’s best-performing stock, is pulling back on a once aggressive global expansion to focus on its core operations to win back investors. Last year was one of the most difficult for Sea since its founding in 2009: it shed about $160 billion of market value from its October 2021 peak as the market turned against money-losing tech companies.Read more: Sea’s Path to Profit Paved With Layoffs, Single-Ply Toilet PaperSecond-quarter sales were $3.1 billion, trailing the $3.2 billion analysts estimated on average. Revenue growth at Shopee decelerated to 21%, the slowest pace on record. Revenue from SeaMoney, the digital financial services business, rose 53%. Net income was $321.6 million, according to Bloomberg calculations based on first-half numbers, topping estimates.The stiffer competition is weighing on the profitability of Sea and regional peers GoTo Group and Grab Holdings Ltd., which are also trying to cope with slowing economic growth, rising costs and a decline in technology company valuations. Grab and Indonesia’s GoTo Group continue to bleed losses.Earlier Tuesday, GoTo cut its 2023 loss projection after staunching some of the bleeding in the latest quarter, taking the Indonesian company closer to its goal of getting into the black after an era of costly expansion. Grab is slated to report second-quarter results later this month.What Bloomberg Intelligence SaysSea should be able to sustain profits after a third consecutive quarter of net income in 2Q — despite missing consensus sales by 3% and e-commerce revenue by 6% — on continued cost discipline and e-commerce monetization, we believe. While sales trends could continue as a fall in promotional incentives and inflation-driven spending cool online shopping, users in gaming, Sea’s biggest profit driver, are rebounding.- Nathan Naidu, analystClick here for the research.Longer term, Sea hasn’t entirely withdrawn from global markets and its Latin American operation could help drive growth, said Nathan Naidu, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.“Sea’s e-commerce expansion in Latin America could kick sales growth back into high gear after a deliberate slowdown to achieve breakeven,” he wrote in a note ahead of the results.(Updates with comment from analyst in fourth paragraph)©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: By Casey HallSHANGHAI (Reuters) - Shanghai driver Zhu Zhimin works 15 hours a day to earn the same money he was making only a few months ago working a regular shift, as he competes with an increasing number of Chinese rushing into the ride-hailing industry.Zhu, who takes home 400-600 yuan ($55-$82) a day ferrying passengers from early morning to late at night, says he wasn't able to take a day off for three months earlier this year."I go back at midnight, I take a shower and then go to bed. I have no spare time," he said from behind the wheel. "My children are getting older, my parents are getting older, so my family needs money."China's weak post-pandemic recovery and record youth unemployment are sending more people into the ride-hailing sector, flooding the market and eroding the incomes of many of the 5.8 million drivers registered for such apps.On Tuesday, a raft of data highlighted how the world's second largest economy had slowed further in July, putting pressure on already faltering growth.About 400,000 people began driving for ride-hailing firms in China between the end of April and the end of July, state media said, citing Ministry of Transport data.Analysts see this more than 7 percent increase in the number of drivers as a manifestation of the subdued job market. Average income for employees in Shanghai is around 525 yuan a day, data from the city government shows, in line with what most drivers make working much longer hours than an office worker."The downturn of the socio-economic environment led to a reduction in job opportunities and an influx of labour into the ride-hailing industry," said Wang Ke, an automotive and travel industry analyst at Analysys, a market research firm."An increasing number of unemployed individuals make the ride-hailing industry their first choice."China has more than 300 ride-hailing apps, which accounted for over 40% of total taxi trips last year, state media reported.Story continuesCities including Shanghai, Sanya and Changsha have suspended issuing new ride-hailing permits. At least four others have issued warnings of overcapacity, with some saying drivers get fewer than 10 orders a day as a result."Because the economy is not doing well, many workers have been laid off and began ride-hailing," said James Cai, 33, from Haikou, the capital of Hainan island and one of the cities warning of too many drivers. "Most of them are 20-30 year olds."Cai said he earns 200-300 yuan a day, driving for Didi Global - China's answer to Uber - from 8.00 am until close to midnight. Up until recently, he made 400 yuan a day plus bonuses, going home before 8.00 pm."This job is not working out," he added.Didi did not respond to emailed questions about driver numbers, pay and the latest curbs in some cities.'SELF-CORRECTION'Wang, from Analysys, expects a market "self-correction" as some drivers drop out.Nanxun Li, another Haikou driver, sold his car last month and quit a job he had been doing for 10 years, after his income dropped to 300-400 yuan a day from 1,000 when he first started."It's getting difficult to make ends meet," Li said.But even with less drivers, making a living is likely to become more difficult for many people as China enters an era of much slower economic growth, economists say.More than 21% of Chinese youth were unemployed as of June. China's statistics bureau said on Tuesday it will stop releasing jobless youth data, drawing public ire.Shanghai driver Li Weimin's rationale for working underscores the shrinking job market."I don’t eat during the day, and I only have one meal after I get home at night," said the 45-year-old, who drives from 6.30 am to 1 am to take home around 500 yuan."But I must persist, because there is no other job."($1 = 7.2761 Chinese yuan renminbi)(Reporting by Casey Hall and Xihao Jiang in Shanghai and the Beijing and Shanghai newsrooms; editing by Marius Zaharia and Miral Fahmy)

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- The rally in equities is set to grind to a halt as investors come to grips with slowing US growth, and seasonal factors are likely to compound the selling pressure, according to Vantage Point Asset Management.Tighter lending standards and fledgling signs of slack in the labor market suggest that the US economy is headed for a hard landing, said Nicholas Ferres, chief investment officer of the global macro fund. In July, the money manager took net long exposure for his firm’s main fund to 10% — “virtually flat,” in his words.“It’s more likely toward September, October rather than August but it could be underway now,” Ferres said, referring to when seasonal factors are likely to exert pressure. “People will be panicking and selling — that’s the opportunity for us to scale up.”Traders are grappling with the rising prospect of a correction in equities after a rally catapulted the S&P 500 Index to within 7% of an all-time high. Ferres’ forecast jives with the views of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Marko Kolanovic who’s urging investors to stay underweight on stocks on expectations that the global economy is likely to slip into a recession.Ferres was a portfolio manager at Eastspring Investments and Goldman Sachs’ asset management arm prior to Vantage, which has around $800 million in assets under management.He expects the effects of monetary tightening to exacerbate the impact of seasonal factors, with August and September historically registering as the worst months for US stocks.Vantage Point is priming for a pullback in risk markets that will open the door for it to build holdings in hard-hit assets, including Chinese equities, said Ferres. He also plans to replicate a formerly winning trade — buying up large technology firms such as Baidu Inc and JD.com Inc — while avoiding property developers.Story continuesIn the credit market, the fund managers favors the iShares USD Asia High Yield Bond Index ETF.Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist for Invesco, is similarly skeptical of the soft-landing scenario and is preparing for a drawdown in risk assets.“In terms of equities, I think that we could see some headwinds in the US and other developed markets in the near term,” she said in an interview with Bloomberg Television last week. “There’s no way the Fed can do the level of tightening it has done so aggressively and not have some damage — that’s why I think it will be a bumpy landing.”©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- S&P Global Inc.’s surprise decision to stop providing ESG scores alongside bond-issuer assessments has created a divide at the top of the credit-ratings market, as Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings say they won’t follow suit.S&P recently updated its approach to incorporating environmental, social and governance considerations into credit ratings, ditching an alphanumerical scale it introduced in 2021 and instead going back to relying only on text descriptions. The decision follows feedback from investors who said they found the ESG scale confusing, according to a person familiar with the process who asked not to be identified discussing private talks.The S&P move “acknowledges the ‘dirty secret’ that many in sustainable finance have long known: assessing ‘ESG performance’ in a single, transparent metric that gives a clear signal that is useful for investors is simply not possible,” said Andrew Howell, senior director of sustainable finance at the Environmental Defense Fund, a nonprofit whose recent work includes helping advise the US government on the Inflation Reduction Act.There’s little consensus on how best to measure an entity’s ESGness. This year, regulators in Europe tried to address some of the growing investor confusion by unveiling plans to force data providers to be more transparent and consistent. What’s more, ESG score providers that also sell services such as credit ratings will need to keep those businesses separate to avoid conflicts of interest.Including ESG scores in credit ratings is proving particularly sensitive, given the potential to influence an issuer’s borrowing costs.Story continuesSome sustainability experts that Bloomberg spoke with said numerical scales aren’t capable of capturing the list of complex factors that ESG represents, which includes everything from climate change to workers’ rights.Even so, S&P’s updated handling of ESG in debt ratings now makes it an outlier among the big three in the industry.Richard Hunter, chief credit officer at Fitch, said investors like the numerical system because it “crisply identifies individual issuers with actual rating changes that can be classified as driven by a factor which has a direct relevance for ESG as well.”A Moody’s spokesperson said the firm “incorporates all risks, including those related to ESG, into its credit ratings when they are material, and also publishes ESG scores on a 1-to-5 scale.”Sara Schoen, the founder of Schoen Sustainability, argues that ESG “is inescapably complex but can be simplified and de-complicated far more than it has been to enable reasonable understanding and manageability for all involved,” in a LinkedIn comment responding to S&P’s decision.Meanwhile, anti-ESG Republicans have lambasted such scores in debt ratings as more evidence of Wall Street’s embrace of so-called woke ideology. Last year, Utah’s governor and its federal lawmakers singled out S&P for its decision to publish ESG indicators for US states, calling it an undue politicization of the ratings process.And Republicans were quick to claim S&P’s decision to ditch its ESG scale as a victory.“I applaud S&P’s public comments indicating they are changing course and following the law by putting its shareholders before a political agenda,” Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey said in a statement, in which he also characterized ESG as “illegal, woke investing.”S&P’s decision to back away from ESG scores in its credit ratings was unrelated to any political threats, the person familiar with the process told Bloomberg. A spokesperson for S&P said the decision to stop publishing ESG credit indicators is “independent” and “analytical.” The spokesperson also said that S&P will “continue to include the dedicated narrative paragraphs focused on ESG credit factors.”Ethan Powell, chief executive officer of Impact Shares, a nonprofit exchange-traded fund issuer based in Dallas, said S&P’s decision reflects “the difficulty in assigning numerical values to qualitative social and environmental factors.” He also points out that there’s “political and regulatory pressure to better understand and define how ESG is used in the market.”Meanwhile, the issue continues to divide the wider credit ratings industry. Kroll Bond Rating Agency said it doesn’t use ESG scores because to do so “raises confusion.” DBRS Morningstar also eschews a number scale but applies up to 17 ESG factors including climate risk, human rights and corruption, in its credit ratings.Daniel Klier, CEO of sustainability data provider ESG Book, said he was “surprised” S&P backed away because the credit rating process is anyway so numerical. S&P should instead have strengthened its ESG scoring system to make it more “objective, transparent and data driven,” he said.Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP and affiliates provide access to ESG data products, including Bloomberg’s proprietary ESG scores.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- The United Steelworkers are making it clear that the union exclusively supports Cleveland-Cliffs Inc.’s bid to buy United States Steel Corp.USW President Tom Conway said the union only endorses one bid for the iconic American steelmaker, saying that the Cleveland-based producer’s plan will preserve union jobs. The comment comes after Conway said he received countless calls from potential bidders seeking the union’s approval — a necessary legal step for anyone seeking to buy US Steel, because the labor group has the right to counter, Conway said.“I was adamant that the Cliffs bid is the only one the union will consider due to its synergies and the fact that it best preserves blast furnace and steelmaking capacity and the jobs of USW members,” Conway said Tuesday in an interview. “The union is committed to that proposal and the USS board should move quickly to conclude this transaction.”Cliffs published a letter from the Steelworkers on Sunday stating the union endorsement as it jousted with US Steel over its takeover offer. Monday’s higher all-cash bid by Esmark Inc. created market confusion because it was unclear whether the lesser-known firm — or others that US Steel said made unsolicited offers — sought union approval.Conway said the union won’t support any other bidder, domestic or foreign.Shares of US Steel dropped 2.1% to $30.43 at 12:56 p.m. in New York.

Text Content: A senior couple talks about their 401(k) withdrawals and financial plan for retirement. Congress could soon change how spouses access their retirement accounts. A pair of Democratic bills recently introduced in the House and Senate would require spouses to consent before either one can make any withdrawals from their 401(k) accounts. The bills, sponsored by Rep. Lauren Underwood, D-Illinois, and Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisconsin, seek to amend the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) and potentially change how some married couples access their 401(k) funds.Need help planning for retirement? Consider speaking with a financial advisor today.The State of Current LawCurrently, spousal authority over retirement accounts ranges widely. Some accounts, like many pensions, can have significant consent rules when it comes to making any changes to the account or its terms. This is generally because each section of a pension "belongs" to either the retiree or their spouse, so unilateral changes would mean seizing someone else's property rights.Others, most notably many 401(k) plans, work similarly to a shared private portfolio. Both spouses can unilaterally withdraw money, take loans and make other changes to the accounts at will. However, there are some boundaries around this authority – for example, a spouse cannot unilaterally change the beneficiaries of a 401(k). Defined benefits contribution plans, meanwhile, are broadly treated as fully joint assets.In 2022, voices in the retirement services community began to call for Congress to reexamine this practice. As SmartAsset wrote at the time:"Despite their rise in popularity, 401(k) and other defined contribution plans offer little if any spousal protection… Aside from a primary residence, retirement accounts are often the largest asset for married couples, making them potential targets in cases of separation and divorce. Current law permits one spouse to withdraw the entire amount without the other spouse's consent or knowledge, and that could potentially prove devastating to a family's future finances."Story continuesProposed ChangesTwo proposed bills have been introduced on Capitol Hill that would require spousal consent for withdrawals from 401(k)s. The proposed legislation would update the ERISA statute that governs most tax-advantaged retirement accounts. The new rules would require that both spouses consent before taking withdrawals or other distributions from a defined contribution plan, such as a 401(k).In practice, this means that both spouses would need to sign the related forms before either spouse can take money from a 401(k) or related plan.The proposed legislation does not affect IRA plans, which will continue to allow unilateral withdrawals without spousal consent.The American Retirement Association (ARA), which comprises five different retirement-focused organizations, is taking a wait-and-see approach to the proposed legislation."While we support the policy goal behind this proposal, which is to protect the retirement security of a spouse, more research needs to be done on this approach to determine whether it would do greater harm than good," Andrew Remo, Director of Federal and State Legislative Affairs for the ARA said in a release.Bottom LineSpouses who hold 401(k) accounts may soon need permission from each other before they make any withdrawals from their portfolios, under Democratic legislation that’s been proposed in Washington D.C. According to current law, spouses can make withdrawals from 401(k)s, take loans and make other changes to their accounts at will.Financial Protection TipsPhoto credit: ©iStock.com/Inside Creative House, ©iStock.com/traveler1116The post Spouses May Soon Need to Agree on 401(k) Withdrawals Under This Proposed Law appeared first on SmartReads by SmartAsset.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- The yield on 10-year US Treasuries is at the top end of its range, providing a good entry point for investors, according to Steven Major, global head of fixed-income research at HSBC Plc.The US Treasury market selloff has been escalating, pushing the 10-year yield above 4.2% this week as investors pared expectations for Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts next year. That makes the asset class competitive relative to equities and credit, according to Major.It’s also the highest level in this duration since October, when the Federal Reserve’s policy rate was a full 225 basis points lower. That means the market has absorbed a large amount of tightening from the last time the yield was at the same level.“I think we’ll be nearer to three than five in a year’s time” on the 10-year yield, Major said in a Bloomberg Television interview Wednesday. “Going up the US curve to 10 year-plus is now looking more and more interesting because we’re at the top of the range and more fundamentally the real yield is covering the trend GDP.”The Treasuries selloff stalled on Tuesday as investors seized on the higher yields, after stronger-than-anticipated retail sales data for July reinforced the case for the Fed to raise interest rates further.Major’s view dovetails with that of firms like JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Western Asset Management, which say this month’s jump in bond yields represents a buying opportunity given central banks are getting close to the end of their rate-hike cycles. Those come as investors like Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, one of Canada’s largest institutional investors, are making bigger bets on bonds and credit.Story continuesMajor also said Treasuries remain a safe instrument and the decision by Fitch to downgrade the US’s credit ratings shouldn’t affect its fundamentals. However, the move might have helped fuel the rise in yields, he said.--With assistance from David Ingles.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: Palo Alto Networks PANW is scheduled to report its fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 results on Aug 18.Palo Alto projects its fiscal fourth-quarter revenues in the $1.937-$1.967 billion range, suggesting a year-over-year increase of 25%-27%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $1.96 billion, implying growth of 26.1% from the year-ago reported figure.For the fiscal fourth quarter, the company expects non-GAAP earnings in the range of $1.26-$1.30 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PANW’s non-GAAP earnings stands at $1.28 per share, indicating an increase of 60% from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of 80 cents.Palo Alto’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 20.3%.Palo Alto Networks, Inc. Price and EPS SurprisePalo Alto Networks, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Palo Alto Networks, Inc. QuoteFactors to Note Ahead of Q4 ResultsIn the fourth quarter, Palo Alto is likely to have benefited from the strong momentum stemming from deal wins, which is expected to have boosted its top line. The strong demand for form factor hardware products, particularly machine learning-powered models that ensure zero-trust network security for organizations, is expected to have contributed to the quarterly performance.The growing and accelerated migration to the cloud in a post-pandemic era is likely to have boosted the adoption of the aforementioned platforms. The company projects year-over-year billings growth between 17% and 19% ($3.15 billion-$3.20 billion) in the to-be-reported quarter. Our estimate for billings is pegged at $3.18 billion.Moreover, the increased use of the cloud and remote networks amid a hybrid working environment has resulted in escalating cyberattacks currently. This is leading to a rise in the demand for cybersecurity solutions. PANW’s fiscal fourth-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from this demand surge.Palo Alto has been gaining from the Bridgecrew acquisition, which forms the crux of the Prisma public cloud and Xpanse, which form the basis of Cortex. Prisma and Cortex are likely to have continued performing well in the fiscal fourth quarter as well.Story continuesOur estimates for the company’s Product and Subscription & Support revenues are pegged at $499.6 million and $1.45 billion, respectively.Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) recognitions are boosting the adoption of Palo Alto’s products by government organizations. The company’s Prisma Access, Cortex XDR, Cortex Data Lake, Prisma Cloud and WildFire received FedRAMP recognitions.This FedRAMP recognition reflects the U.S. public sector’s trust in Palo Alto’s IoT security solutions. This is anticipated to have encouraged the adoption of its products during the period in discussion.What Our Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for PANW this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat.

Text Content: Not even Fed Chair Jay Powell can be accused of ever moving that far this fast.In an emergency meeting on Tuesday, Russia’s central bank governing board decided to increase interest rates by 3.5 percentage points, reaching 12%. This action aims to prop up the ruble, which has been significantly impacted by Western sanctions in response to the conflict in Ukraine.“This decision is aimed at limiting price stability risk,” it said in a statement, justifying its second hike in less than a month by citing “substantial” upside risks to inflation from the collapsing currency.Just four days prior, a deputy governor had dismissed concerns around the exchange rate in comments to state news agency TASS.The move comes after the country’s ruble broke below the psychological floor of 100 to a U.S. dollar, rendering each less valuable than a penny.The currency has now surrendered all of its gains from last year to plumb depths not seen since an investor panic in the early days of the war.Pressure on the bank subsequently rose to a fever pitch, with Kremlin mouthpiece and Putin ally Vladimir Solovyov demanding on his Russian state TV show that the central bank take action.Prior to the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Putin’s industries had long been dependent on the West. In exchange for selling commodities like food, energy, and base metals such as nickel, Russia could purchase the machinery and equipment it needed to run its factories.Western sanctions however have crippled manufacturers’ ability to provide for their consumers by limiting access to key intermediates including microchips that could help them expand their output.In its statement on Tuesday, the bank blamed consumers forced to increasingly look abroad in order to satisfy their demand for finished goods.This exerted heavy downward pressure on the ruble and threatened the central bank’s price stability target of 4% as imported inflation is now spilling over into the broader economy.Story continuesRaising the main policy rate to 12% from a previous 8.5% so soon after a July hike is a tacit admission that the bank’s most recent 100 basis point move less than four weeks ago was far from sufficient to put a floor under the ruble.Even when Fed Chair Powell was in full-blown inflation-fighting mode, he only hiked at a pace of 75 bps during four consecutive meetings stretching across a six-month time frame.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

Source: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vietnams-vinfast-faces-stern-ev-060844598.html
Text Content: By Phuong Nguyen and Francesco GuarascioHANOI (Reuters) - Vietnam's EV champion VinFast has managed to sell Wall Street on a Nasdaq listing that values the loss-making startup at more than $85 billion, almost twice as much as Ford or General Motors.Now comes the hard part: moving overseas growth out of the slow lane.VinFast needs to deliver more than twice the sales notched up so far this year in the remaining five months to hit a stretch annual target set by its founder of selling 50,000 EVs. For that, it needs to complete a revamp of a sales strategy to bring in distributors and dealers rather than selling through its own platform alone, an approach it borrowed from Tesla.It will also require bringing costs down to compete on price with the likes of Tesla, which has been using its scale and industry-leading margins to cut prices and pile pressure on rivals since the start of the year.Shares of dedicated EV maker VinFast, which merged with special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Black Spade, surged on their Nasdaq debut on Tuesday. Since 99% of the company is controlled by VinFast's founder, Pham Nhat Vuong, the stock's tiny float makes it subject to more volatility.Other EV SPAC deals, including Lucid, which Black Spade used as the basis of its initial $23 billion valuation of VinFast, have seen their shares tumble after listing. Lucid is valued now at under $15 billion, nearly 40% less than its $24 billion SPAC valuation in 2021.VinFast's intent to raise additional capital is also a potential threat to its lofty valuation. CFO David Mansfield said on Tuesday the company was talking to a range of investors, including sovereign wealth funds, and was on track to raise additional funding in the next 18 months."Like any transaction, pricing is set by the market," CEO Le Thi Thu Thuy told Reuters when asked about the terms of a future investment. "So it's not like we can say that you use our equity or stock (price) today."Story continuesThe VinFast listing creates a way for the automaker, which has struggled to retain senior executives, to offer share-based compensation, a prospect spelled out in its filings.BRINGING IN PARTNERSVinFast CEO Thuy said on Tuesday the EV maker would be shifting to a new "hybrid model" for sales, bringing in distributors and dealers for overseas markets. Since it announced its overseas expansion plans, VinFast had been counting on just using its own showrooms, like Tesla does."Opening our own stores is great but it takes a lot of time," she said. "Joining forces with other partners to go faster has always been our nature."VinFast opened 122 showrooms globally as of June, the company said, concentrated on the U.S. West Coast.Founder Vuong had said in May that VinFast could sell 50,000 EVs this year. Through the first seven months, it has sold over 16,000, including its sales in Vietnam. That includes sales of just 137 of its VF8 model in the United States, the only model it currently sells there.“The ballpark numbers that our chairman indicated for this year are still on track,” CFO Mansfield said.Even at that target, VinFast will be only selling at roughly a sixth of the production capacity it has at its Haiphong, Vietnam plant. A new plant is under construction in North Carolina and scheduled to begin operations in 2025.Consultancy AlixPartners has said it estimates EV makers need annual sales of 400,000 vehicles to break even, including in China, where most are losing money in a deepening price war for market share.Pricing is another challenge and Tesla has kept the pressure on, introducing a cheaper version of its Model S and Model X on Tuesday. The Tesla Model Y is almost $7,000 cheaper than VinFast's VF8 after including federal subsidies.Thuy said VinFast believed its products were priced competitively but was working to bring prices down. "There is no other (automaker) in the world that has as low a cost base as in Vietnam," she said. "All of that is leading to cost reduction in the future."(Editing by Kevin Krolicki and Muralikumar Anantharaman)

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- It would have been a pretty standard corporate dispute for Wall Street to bet on, if it weren’t for the meme stock crowd.A court’s approval of an AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. stock conversion plan last week ended a long legal tug-of-war between the movie theater chain and a small army of retail investors, who fiercely opposed the plan and helped delay it by months.The involvement of these investors, who turned beaten-down stocks like AMC and GameStop Corp. into viral memes and winners for a time, injected extra uncertainty into the situation. And it gave Wall Street traders — who were wagering on whether the proposed conversion plan would pass legal muster, and looking to profit from the outcome — a vexing new factor to consider.Read More: AMC’s Revised Stock Conversion Plan Is Approved by Court“Retail investors on their own have very little influence over corporate actions,” said Campbell Harvey, a professor at Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business. “However, when they band together and act as one, they can attain the influence of a large institutional investor or a hedge fund. The meme investor social network makes it much easier to launch a legal attack.”Friday’s decision by Delaware Chancery Judge Morgan Zurn capped a bitter legal battle over AMC preferred equity units, or APEs, which pitted the company’s top executives against that retail investor base.Zurn had surprised the market last month by rejecting an earlier version of the settlement, which she found waived too many potential claims against the company. The disclosure of the first settlement drew more than 3,500 communications from about 2,850 shareholders, prompting Zurn to appoint a special master to handle the flood, further delaying the process.Story continues‘Extraordinary’ ShareholdersChris Colpitts, director of event-driven strategies at TD Cowen, says the attention the case got may have ultimately pushed the judge to be more of a stickler for procedure.“Normally in class action settlements nobody comments, nobody objects,” Colpitts said. “In AMC there was so much interest and attention that she may have been more focused on ensuring the correct procedural steps were taken.”Read More: AMC Shares Surge on Court Ruling, With New Settlement FiledIn her July opinion, Zurn said the objections themselves didn’t inform her decision to reject the settlement. But she called AMC’s shareholder base “extraordinary” and said it included “a great number of human owners who care passionately about their stock ownership and the company,” calling the reaction to the notice of settlement “unprecedented.”Big LossesFor the arbitragers betting on the conversion, the prolonged legal saga has turned seemingly easy money into a high-risk proposition. They set up the trade through stocks and options, and the twists and turns forced them to hold their wagers longer than they planned, eating into any profits.The small investors “overloaded” the court with their objections, said Julian Klymochko, chief executive officer of Accelerate Financial Technologies, which has an arbitrage-focused fund.“Many only have, like, a very, very, very small monetary stake” but used it to cause “hundreds of millions of dollars of economic damage to arbitragers,” Klymochko said. He added that it was “irrational that some retail investors were trying to prevent this conversion deal, which, if it hadn’t gone through, the company would’ve gone bankrupt and their shares would’ve been zero.”Read More: Arb Traders Handed 150% Gains or 260% Losses on AMC-APE WagerThe delay was especially perilous since many were borrowing the stock to short it and had to pay hefty daily financing costs to maintain their positions, plus face the risk of a short squeeze. Some could lose more than 250% on the trade, according to analysis from data firm S3 Partners.Wild RideThe stock has taken a wild ride as hedge funds and other traders bought APE positions and went short the common shares. They were betting on pocketing the price difference between the two once the conversion went through and narrowed the gap. Zurn’s rejection of the plan in July forced some to start unwinding that bet to limit their risk, sending the common shares soaring. Her approval on Friday sank them.“The thing that has been kind of really crazy about this case is the meme stock investors that hold the common stock, some of them are like, ‘We don’t want to settle at all — we just want to stick it to everyone,’” said Eric Talley, a corporate law expert at Columbia Law School.Read More: AMC-APE Spread Hits Tightest Ever as Court Approves ConversionThe dispute started in February when the Allegheny County Employees’ Retirement System sued AMC, alleging it was using complex corporate engineering to sideline small investors. The pension fund claimed AMC was empowering holders of the APEs at retail investors’ expense — for example, by selling almost 30% of the units to hedge fund Antara Capital LP to win its support for the share conversion plan.Extra SecurityThe meme crowd was so incensed that the court even took additional security measures for a hearing on the deal in Wilmington in late June. Two extra rooms with a live feed from the courtroom were reserved.In the end only a handful of the two dozen objectors scheduled to testify showed up. They included a man who said he had driven 10 hours from Tennessee to speak in public for the first time and a US Air Force veteran who delivered a wide-ranging, emotional broadside on Wall Street corruption.“Anytime an arbitrage position intersects with a meme stock,” TD Cowen’s Colpitts said, “caution is warranted.”Read More: Microsoft-Activision Trial Has Merger Arbitragers Glued to CourtThe case is AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc.

Text Content: Behind heavily in the polls, presidential hopeful Ron DeSantis has a message for Disney boss Bob Iger: You owe me.Attempts by the Florida governor to build a run for the White House around a feud with his state’s largest employer backfired when the Mouse House fought back with a lawsuit that threatens to leave neither a winner.Now DeSantis, who has recently come under fire among free-market Republican donors for his “fatal error” targeting corporations, wants bygones to be bygones and appealed to Iger to drop the case citing their strong relations in the past.“No one has made Disney more money recently than me, because during COVID they were open in Florida. They were locked shut in California,” he told CNBC in comments aired on Monday.Like virtually all companies in the entertainment and hospitality industries, the pandemic was a financial disaster for Disney.According to its fiscal 2020 and 2021 accounts, Disney’s otherwise lucrative parks division alone incurred roughly $8.5 billion in combined losses over the two years. This doesn’t even include the nearly $600 million in total added charges for severance-related layoffs.Walt Disney World near Orlando, a massive 25,000-acre resort roughly 50 times the size of California’s Disneyland, was however able to reopen in mid-July of 2020—albeit under numerous precautionary measures to safeguard public health and operating well under capacity.By comparison, Disney openly expressed it was “extremely disappointed” that the state of California would not let it open its smaller theme park in Anaheim, Calif.Disneyland only began welcoming visitors again on April 30 of the following year, after being closed for more than 13 months straight.DeSantis urges Iger to drop the lawsuit against FloridaDeSantis, who on Monday was quick to remind Disney’s board they had a friend in him when they needed it most, now needs to call in as many favors as he can.Donald Trump has opened up an almost unassailable lead in the polls. DeSantis was once the front-runner after the ex-president’s slate of candidates cost the GOP key races in the November midterm elections.Story continuesYet the governor has seen his stock plummet amid criticism he comes across as wooden, inauthentic, and unrelatable. While campaigning at the Iowa State Fair on Saturday, he was nearly drowned out by jeers.In an effort to narrow the lead, DeSantis has shifted his sights onto Anheuser-Busch in hopes the luckless beer brewer proves an easier target.Whereas he instructed Florida officials to examine a possible lawsuit against the Bud Light parent on behalf of his state’s employee pension fund, he explicitly said he would stop short of doing so when it came to Disney.“We’ve basically moved on. They’re suing the state of Florida,” he said, speaking of Disney’s board during his CNBC interview on Monday. “They’re going to lose that lawsuit, so what I would say is, drop the lawsuit.”Disney, which has threatened to pull investment out of the state amid claims of a “relentless campaign to weaponize government power,” could not be immediately reached by Fortune for comment.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

Source: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-bought-3-stocks-203900108.html
Text Content: Warren Buffett is widely recognized as the greatest investor of all time, so when he buys new stocks, investors tend to take notice. According to its latest 13F filing, which came out yesterday, Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway initiated positions in just three new stocks during the second quarter — NVR (NYSE:NVR), Lennar (NYSE:LEN), and D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI). Interestingly, all three are homebuilders.While investors should always do their own due diligence before making any investment, taking inspiration from Buffett’s moves isn’t a bad idea, and luckily for investors who want to follow the Oracle of Omaha’s lead, there’s an ETF that owns large positions in all three of Berkshire Hathaway’s recently added positions — the iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (BATS:ITB).ITB is a $2.5 billion ETF from BlackRock’s iShares that gives investors, according to BlackRock, “exposure to U.S. companies that manufacture residential homes” by investing in “an index composed of U.S. equities in the home construction sector.” Let’s take a closer look at this home construction-focused ETF and why it’s an effective way to invest in Buffett’s new buys.Why Homebuilders?While the move has been a bit under the radar, homebuilders have actually posted a strong rally year-to-date — for example, ITB is up 44.4% year-to-date. We previously covered the move to the upside in homebuilder ETFs when the rally was starting to kick into full gear earlier this summer.While these stocks have rallied off of their previous lows, the fact that all three of Berkshire’s new buys are homebuilders seems to indicate that Buffett and his portfolio managers have conviction in the idea and see value in the space as a whole.Buffett is, first and foremost, a value investor, and despite the aforementioned rally, homebuilders (including the ones Buffett bought) still look like a bargain. For instance, D.R. Horton is valued at 13.2 times earnings, Lennar trades for 12.7 times earnings, and NVR has a price-to-earnings multiple of 13.7.Story continuesThese leading homebuilders all trade at sizable discounts to the broader market — the S&P 500 currently has a price-to-earnings multiple of about 20. The ITB ETF itself is even cheaper than these individual stocks, with an average price-to-earnings ratio of 9.5.Furthermore, many analysts and observers believe that there is a long-term shortage of new housing in the United States, so these homebuilders could have the wind at their backs over the long term as supply catches up with demand.ITB’s HoldingsNot only does ITB own all three of Berkshire’s new buys, but they are also actually its three largest holdings, as you can see in the overview of ITB’s top 10 holdings below.D.R. Horton is the fund’s top holding, with a weighting of 14.8%. Lennar is ITB’s second-largest position, with a 12.1% weighting, while NVR is its third-largest holding, with a weighting of 7.3%. Clearly, ITB gives investors significant exposure to the newest additions to Buffett’s portfolio, as these three new buys make up over a third of ITB’s assets.Beyond these three Buffett buys, the fund also owns other prominent homebuilders, including its fourth-largest holding, Pultegroup, as well as Toll Brothers, Meritage Homes, and Taylor Morrison.Additionally, the fund owns other companies that either serve or supply the homebuilding industry, such as paint maker Sherwin-Williams, home improvement juggernaut Home Depot, and building materials suppliers like Builders Firstsource and TopBuild.ITB Vs. XHB ETF — Which Should You Choose to Follow Buffett?Many readers may be familiar with another popular homebuilder ETF, the SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (NYSEARCA:XHB). So why should an investor looking to invest like Buffett choose ITB over XHB?The answer is that while XHB owns Lennar, D.R. Horton, and NVR, it doesn’t give investors nearly as much exposure to these three stocks as ITB does. In fact, as you can see in the table below, none of these three names occupy a place within XHB’s top 10 holdings.Within XHB, D.R. Horton has a weighting of just 3.7%, Lennar has a weighting of 3.7%, and NVR comes in at 3.6%.These are both good ETFs, and this isn’t to say that ITB is a better ETF than XHB, but for readers looking to invest like Buffett, ITB is clearly the better option as it has much larger positions in his three new holdings.Is ITB Stock a Buy, According to Analysts? Turning to Wall Street, ITB has a Moderate Buy consensus rating, as 56% of analyst ratings are Buys, 36.7% are Holds, and 7.3% are Sells. At $96.25, the average ITB stock price target implies 8.54% upside potential.Long-Term Performance Homebuilding is known to be a cyclical industry, but looking at it over the years to smooth out the ups and downs, on average, ITB has posted some pretty solid returns. As of the end of the most recent quarter, ITB’s three-year annualized total return stood at a very impressive 25.4%. Using this same time frame, over the past five years, the ETF’s five-year annualized return is 18.3%, and over the past 10 years, it generated a 14.9% annualized total return.These results mean that ITB has outperformed the broader market over the same time frame — as of the end of last quarter, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:VOO) had three-, five-, and 10-year annualized total returns of 14.6%, 12.3%, and 12.8%, respectively.Additional Considerations One minor downside of ITB that investors should take note of is that while it isn’t an overly-expensive ETF in terms of fees, it isn’t particularly cheap either, with an expense ratio of 0.40%. This means that an investor allocating $10,000 into ITB would pay $40 in fees in year one. Over the course of a decade, these fees add up, and the same investor would pay $505 in fees, assuming the expense ratio remains the same and that the fund returns 5% per annum.It should be said that the expense ratio isn’t out of line with its nearest competitor, XHB, which charges an expense ratio of 0.35%.On the plus side, ITB is a dividend payer, although its current yield is just 0.6%.Bottom LineThe 13F filings that investment firms file with the SEC give investors a window into the portfolios and the trades of top investors like Buffett. Investors should always do their own research before making an investment, but learning about and following the moves of all-time great investors is a great starting point when it comes to generating new investment ideas.It’s interesting that all three stocks that Buffett and his portfolio managers initiated positions in during the second quarter are the same types of businesses. Clearly, the team at Berkshire Hathaway likes what it sees in the homebuilder space, which features cheap valuations and potential long-term tailwinds. The ITB ETF gives investors the opportunity to gain significant exposure to this industry and all three of Buffett’s new stocks in one investment vehicle.Disclosure

Text Content: MOSCOW (Reuters) -Russia's central bank hiked its key interest rate by 350 basis points to 12% on Tuesday, an emergency rate move to try and halt the rouble's weakening past 100 to the dollar after a public call from the Kremlin for tighter monetary policy.The extraordinary rate meeting came after the rouble plummeted past the 100 threshold against the dollar on Monday, dragged down by the impact of Western sanctions on Russia's balance of trade and as military spending soars.President Vladimir Putin's economic adviser Maxim Oreshkin on Monday rebuked the central bank blaming what he called its soft monetary policy on the weakening rouble.Hours after Oreshkin's words, as the rouble dived towards the 102 mark against the dollar, the bank announced the emergency meeting, throwing the currency a lifeline."Inflationary pressure is building up," the bank said in a statement on Tuesday. "The decision is aimed at limiting price stability risks."The pass-through of the rouble's depreciation to prices is gaining momentum and inflation expectations are on the rise."The bank last made an emergency rate hike in late February 2022 with a rate raise to 20% in the immediate fallout of Russia's despatching troops to Ukraine. The bank then steadily lowered the cost of borrowing to 7.5% as strong inflation pressure eased in the second half of 2022.Since its last cut in September 2022, the bank had held rates but steadily increased its hawkish rhetoric, eventually hiking by 100 basis points to 8.5% at its last scheduled meeting in July. The next rate decision is due on Sept. 15.(Reporting by Reuters; Writing by Alexander Marrow; editing by Guy Faulconbridge)

Text Content: The provider of Yellow's bankruptcy financing could be announced on Thursday. (Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)Apollo Global Management has sold the term loan it held for Yellow Corp. and has withdrawn its proposal for bankruptcy financing, according to Financial Times.Miami-based hedge fund Citadel has acquired Yellow’s $485 million debt from Apollo and other lenders. A Tuesday Delaware bankruptcy court filing showed counsel representing Citadel Credit Master Fund would depose representatives from Yellow on Wednesday regarding post-petition financing.Apollo’s (NYSE: APO) debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing package was touted in bankruptcy filings as the only viable offer made to the less-than-truckload carrier in the days leading up to its Chapter 11 petition. The $142.5 million deal was expected to provide the company with the funds necessary to market and sell off its terminals and equipment.The deal would have also provided the private equity firm with an improved lien position among secured creditors. It held first-lien position on the term loan as well as a better lien position than the U.S. Treasury, which is due $737 million from a 2020 COVID relief loan to the carrier.However, representation for Yellow said last week that better offers came forward following the bankruptcy petition and that Apollo’s terms were too onerous. That deal carried a 17% interest rate, a $32 million closing fee and a 90-day window to liquidate the assets.The frontrunners at the time included LTL carrier Estes Express Lines and Boston hedge fund MFN Partners, which acquired a 40% stake in Yellow’s stock in July. However, Yellow attorney Pat Nash said at a Friday hearing there had been “a number of inbounds from other parties” willing to provide new money in a junior position to existing creditors.A Tuesday hearing, which could have potentially revealed the new DIP lender, was pushed backed to Thursday.In recent days, company insiders have been selling restricted and other shares of Yellow ahead of the stock’s delisting on Wednesday.More FreightWaves articles by Todd MaidenStory continuesThis content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.The post Apollo sells Yellow term loan to Citadel appeared first on FreightWaves.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- When Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. quietly submitted its takeover bid for United States Steel Corp. it couldn’t have chosen a more fitting day. That morning, July 28, US Steel Chief Executive Officer David Burritt was sounding as bullish as can be, predicting a once-in-a-generation boom that promises to send demand soaring.For much of the past 15 years, steel was a tough sell to investors who had grown jaded over persistent global gluts and cheap imports. Now, with America’s most iconic steel company in the middle of a potential bidding war, there’s a growing spotlight on the prospect of a boost in domestic steel demand from President Joe Biden’s landmark Inflation Reduction Act.“It’s a manufacturing renaissance act,” US Steel’s Burritt said on his July conference call. “We are on the cusp of a once-in-a-generational steel cycle.”Cliffs’ bid, valued at $7.25 billion based on closing prices last week, would remain secret for a little over two weeks before the situation exploded into the open on Sunday. US Steel has rejected the offer, calling Cliffs’ terms “unreasonable,” and started a formal process to review strategic options. In the latest twist, the bid has now drawn a counter offer from privately owned industrial group Esmark Inc.The Esmark bid has surprised many market watchers, as it hasn’t been active for years in major steel dealmaking and its business is focused on processing and distribution rather than raw steelmaking. Its press release on Monday was also thin on details. But there may be more twists to come: US Steel said over the weekend it had received multiple approaches for part or all of the business.Story continuesA key attraction of US Steel is its exposure to the US auto market, traditionally the most profitable part of the industry. And unlike Cliffs, US Steel has made a huge bet on transitioning its business from blast furnace steel production — where iron ore and coking coal are combined to make primary steel in a highly polluting process — to electric-arc furnaces, where steel scrap is remelted in a much less polluting way.The revived interest in the market stands in sharp contrast to much of the past decade and a half, when too many mills produced too much steel, saturating the global market and keeping prices low. At the same time record Chinese exports flooded the globe, hurting margins further and creating political flashpoints from Brussels to Washington.Yet slowly those problems have eased. China — along with some Western countries — has retired older plants, tariffs and trade barriers have curbed the constant flow of cheap metal looking for a home and the post-Covid economic recovery has buoyed demand from construction to manufacturing markets.Now, it’s the outlook for steel in the US that is getting the industry excited.US industrialists have been singing the praises of the IRA, an infrastructure deal that offers generous subsidies to domestic manufacturers of green technology such as electric-vehicle batteries. The act may drive stronger steel demand in the US, particularly from the metals-intensive renewable energy sector. Steelmakers also will benefit from tax credits for their decarbonization goals.“It’s a potential structural shock on the horizon and picking up assets that feed that could be a profitable move in the medium term,” said Tom Price, head of commodities strategy at Liberum Capital. “This is a really good time to buy metal processing. It’s been a really bad industry for 40 years and suddenly they’re doing something very important.”For prospective buyers of US Steel, the potential growth in demand is especially attractive as lawmakers continue to ringfence the country from the mass imports that previously undercut domestic demand.Steel has become an increasingly hot political subject in Washington, particularly after former President Donald Trump made blue-collar industries like coal and steel a centerpiece of his platform, promising a return to the days of rapid expansion in US manufacturing. Waves of tariffs have made it more difficult to import steel — often leading to disputes with allies in Europe — and underpinned a recovery in steel prices.A combination of US Steel and Cliffs would create the world’s 10th-biggest steelmaker — world No. 2 ArcelorMittal is currently the only non-Asian steelmaker in that list, producing 50% more than Nucor Corp., according to Cliffs.--With assistance from Tiffany Tsoi.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Sea Ltd.’s historic 29% tumble erased close to $10 billion from its market value, wiping out a quarter of co-founder Forrest Li’s fortune overnight while darkening the shopping and gaming leader’s prospects.Southeast Asia’s largest internet firm recorded its biggest single-day plunge after reporting revenue that missed analysts’ estimates, a rude check to a company that overhauled its business to focus on profitability just months ago. In a surprise shift, Li told analysts Tuesday Sea intends to boost investment in the hyper-competitive arena, potentially generating losses going forward.Investors didn’t take that well. The resultant selloff erased $1 billion from Li’s net worth, valued mainly based on his stake and options in the firm, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Li, once Singapore’s richest person with a $20 billion hoard, is now worth $2.9 billion. Co-founders Gang Ye and David Chen lost a combined $700 million. Ye’s wealth currently stands at about $1.9 billion and Chen lost his billionaire status.The question now is if Li’s maneuver will help Sea tackle aggressive competition from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s Lazada as well as new entrants such as ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok, whose livestreamed shopping bonanzas are winning over users in key markets such as Indonesia. The risk is that Sea, which reported losses for more than a decade after its founding in 2009, will sink back into the red after just three profitable quarters.“There is a lack of visibility on the investment’s effectiveness,” Citigroup analyst Alicia Yap said in a note, downgrading the stock to neutral from buy. “A brutal battle could be just starting.”Story continuesRead more: Sea’s Path to Profit Paved With Layoffs, Single-Ply Toilet PaperThe unprecedented retreat in Sea’s stock reversed much of the progress made since late 2022 and again put the Singapore-based company on a back foot. Once the world’s best-performing stock, the company’s capitalization now stands at $23 billion — down about $180 billion from a November 2021 peak when Sea and other internet shares globally were surging.Li’s comments spooked investors long accustomed to watching price-based competition wipe out margins. Sea last year embarked on an aggressive cost-cutting drive to reach profit, pivoting to a focus on the bottom-line as revenue growth decelerated from the triple-digit percentage rates of just two years ago. The company froze salaries and slashed hundreds of millions of dollars in sales and marketing expenses to achieve positive cash flows.Sea’s second-quarter sales rose just 5.2% to $3.1 billion, trailing the $3.2 billion analysts estimated on average. Its e-commerce arm Shopee increased sales 21% — the slowest pace on record. Alibaba grew its international commerce business 41% in the June quarter.To jumpstart growth, Li now intends to ramp up investments into Shopee. He is stepping up efforts to build out its livestreaming arm, an offensive move that could erode margins and trigger a price war with TikTok and Alibaba.Li is trying to reassure investors those efforts are necessary to defend its market share against rivals. Sea has been growing its livestreaming feature, rolling out several campaigns in Indonesia, he said Tuesday. “We have also broadened our assortment of products for our core categories, such as fashion, health and beauty to further enhance our competitive moat in the long term,” he said.Whether that’s enough remains to be seen. Beyond deep-pocketed competitors Alibaba and ByteDance, local rivals such as GoTo Group are also piling the pressure on Sea. GoTo, owner of Indonesian e-commerce contender Tokopedia, on Tuesday said its net revenue almost doubled in the latest quarter.Investor confidence “has been hammered, and the share price is likely to be range bound,” Yap wrote.--With assistance from Yoojung Lee.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: The undeniable inevitability is that everything is going to be electrified, and batteries are our future, as well as the biggest opportunity for investors in a lifetime. Yet, the lithium space has become crowded and chaotic, while the lesser-known critical battery component—graphite—is an extraordinary $23-billion bounty ripe for picking.By 2032, it is projected to be worth an estimated $43 billion.This isn’t about pencils. It’s about the most important element of a multi-trillion-dollar energy transition. It’s about yet another 35% jump in electric vehicle sales expected for 2023, and more explosive growth to follow. It’s about the raw materials that make the batteries to feed this explosive growth.Graphite makes up 95-99% of the anode (negative electrode) material in lithium-ion batteries, in varying natural and synthetic combinations.In fact, according to John DeMaio, CEO of Graphex Technologies and President of the Graphene Division of the Graphex Group Ltd (NYSEAMERICAN:GRFX), many don’t realize that graphite is the largest component by volume in an EV battery “because graphite goes about its business, doing its job quietly, like it’s done ever since the seventies”.Any given lithium-ion battery can contain 15X more graphite than lithium, making up some 25% of a battery’s total volume. It’s also why Elon Musk once opined that lithium-ion batteries should be called “nickel-graphite batteries”.There is no immediately viable solution to effectively replace the lithium-ion battery. Industry-wide, the consensus is that graphite will remain the primary anode material in the foreseeable future.And North America has zero commercial production …Yet, planned North American battery factories represent some 1 million metric tons per year of demand for graphite anode material.That makes this $23-billion market one of the best to be in.Even more so for Graphex Group (NYSEAMERICAN:GRFX), which is creating domestic supply chains of graphite, and is strategically positioned in North America to potentially seize significant market share.Story continuesMidstream Money: The Most Profitable Area of the Graphite Supply ChainOutside of China, there are very few graphite mines currently producing significant quantities of the right quality raw material. There are even fewer with the necessary experience of refining that raw material into the finished anode material we need to meet what promises to be raging demand.The most profitable aspect of the graphite supply chain is refining. Mining itself is wrought with exorbitant costs, regulatory burdens, and challenging operations.Not only is it the most profitable, but it’s also where we see the highest barrier to entry. This is a highly specialized field and battery makers need experienced refiners who can demonstrate scale. In North America, that means Graphex, which has the expertise and technology, and holds patents for everything from products and production methods to machinery design and environmental protection.Graphex Group already has a decade of commercial graphite refining experience and currently produces 10,000 metric tons of finished anode material annually, and they operate on a 24/7 basis, unlike others who have only produced sample materials at a pilot scale. This is a defining factor in the industry.There are few—if any--companies larger than Graphex in terms of production volume outside of China; and they have strong ties to Beijing, which is a riskier selling point in the current geopolitical atmosphere, heightened by a battle for technological dominance through access to critical minerals.While Graphex has extensive experience in China, it is not a Chinese company. Graphex Group Limited is a Cayman Island company with its principal offices in Hong Kong and regional offices in Shanghai and Royal Oak, Michigan, but it is seeking to create a standalone U.S. entity to “make the distinction even more clear, and to qualify unhindered for U.S. and Canadian incentives, grants, loans, etc.,” according to the company’s website.Now, it’s all about bringing critical graphene home to North American markets as the energy transition gains serious momentum.Possibly the Most Important Expansion in our Energy TransitionAlready producing 10,000 tons per annum, Graphex (NYSEAMERICAN:GRFX) is currently implementing a large-scale expansion to increase production to 20,000 tons per annum within the next 12 months, with construction completion and production implementation expected to be concluded within that timeframe, subject to typical construction scheduling.The expansion news has been fast-flowing.In February last year, Graphex announced the joint-venture construction of its first-ever facility outside of Asia—in Warren, Michigan, a 15,000 tons-per-annum plant resurrected from an abandoned manufacturing sight in the Detroit automotive sector. Operations are expected to launch in Q1 2024.Graphex has prioritized North America to localize end-to-end graphite processing and production capabilities, and the 15,000 tpa plant in Michigan is a major step towards that goal.An international collaboration with Canada will also play a role, with Canada eyeing high-level status in the North American critical minerals game.Finally, Graphex has secured raw materials supply from one of the largest, high-quality graphite mines outside of China, with other offtake agreements either secured or in the works—all outside of China.Electrification = Batteries. Batteries = Graphite. Graphite = Graphex.But this could go far beyond batteries and gigafactories.Graphex (NYSEAMERICAN:GRFX) has undertaken extensive scientific research and sees a multitude of applications for graphene that may likely increase demand even further in the future. Graphene’s unique properties will likely have major biomedical use, specifically with targeted drug delivery, smart implants, and tissue engineering. In the industrial sector, graphene-based composites can be used as a non-toxic rust-proofing alternative, as well as an improved coating for touch screens, phones and tablets.Graphene can also be used for enhanced computer circuitry, while graphene supercapacitors are huge boosts of power with comparably little energy. Eventually, because graphene is lightweight, it could be used in the manufacture of cars and planes, significantly reducing their weight. Finally, but not exclusively, graphene ultra-sensitive sensors could detect minute airborne particles, making it a potential preventative technology for any future pandemics.Domesticating the entire graphite supply chain is a daunting task, but Graphex Group has a clear advantage in North America.This is a team of veterans led by DeMaio, who has 35 years of experience in the energy and infrastructure sectors, including as former President, CEO and Board Member of JouleSmart Solutions, general manager of Siemens Smart Infrastructure, VP of MWH Global, VP of SPG Solar and COO of Thompson Solar Technologies.It has a decade of commercial graphite refining experience, but one very distinct advantage: Its would-be competitors are new to midstream graphite. They’re only producing at lab or pilot scale, and scaling up can be accompanied by all sorts of challenges and misfires.Graphex is already producing through full-scale commercial processes with continuous output, and it’s at the forefront of creating one of the most critical North American supply chains of the coming decades.Other resource companies to keep an eye on:Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX), standing tall amidst giants, is revered for its unparalleled focus on copper, molybdenum, and gold.

Text Content: An older man considers when to start taking Social SecurityDespite the fact that delaying the start of your Social Security benefits until age 70 means a 32% increase in the amount you would receive, only 10% of non-retired Americans between the ages of 60 and 65 plan to wait for the larger payout, according to the 2023 Schroders U.S. Retirement Survey.Consider working with a financial advisor to make sure you get the retirement income stream that will meet your needs.Why Some Take Social Security Before Full Retirement Age (FRA)People who wait until after they reach their full retirement age – which is 67 for anyone born in or after 1960 – receive an 8% increase in their monthly benefit payments for every year they delay claiming Social Security up until age 70. Over the course of a 20-years or longer retirement, the difference equals a significant amount of retirement income.Despite that, the study found that 40% of the respondents who still were working said they plan to take their Social Security benefits between the ages of 62 and 65, leaving them short of qualifying for their maximum retirement benefits – even though they are aware that waiting longer would earn them higher payments.Rather, respondents had other concerns: 44% said they were so worried that Social Security would run out of money that they would take benefits earlier to maximize the amount of money they'd collect. Another 36% said they expect to claim benefits before age 70 because they know they'll need the money sooner."We have a crisis of confidence in the Social Security system and it's costing American workers real money," said Deb Boyden, head of U.S. Defined Contribution at Schroders. "Fear about the stability of Social Security has people walking away from money that could improve their quality of life in retirement. Many are not even waiting for their full benefit let alone the maximum, which means they will have to create more income on their own, making it even more important to save and invest earlier for retirement."Story continuesThose fears stem from reports that the Old-Age & Survivors Insurance Trust Fund (OASI) fund that supplies money for Social Security payments is projected to start falling short beginning in 2033. One leading solution cited by experts and backed by the Biden administration is to raise the limit for the payroll tax that finances Social Security, while a number of Republican lawmakers and some Republican presidential contenders say the solution is to raise the age of eligibility for receiving Social Security benefits or reduce future benefits for workers in their 20s.How Much People Think They Need to RetireAn older couple enjoying their retirementThe survey also found that to enjoy a comfortable retirement, non-retired survey participants said they'd need to receive $4,940, on average. Millennials who are still working projected that they'd need $5,135 per month while workers getting closer to their full retirement age, between the ages of 60 and 65, said they'd need $4,855 per month to be comfortable. That compares to current retirees who said their total monthly income averages $4,710, including Social Security. However, 37% reported that their total monthly income totaled less than $2,500.People who'd engaged in more active preparations for retirement reported higher average retirement incomes. Overall, the study found, the average monthly income for retirees with a financial advisor, including Social Security, was $5,075. And for retirees with a formal financial plan, their monthly income averaged $5,810, almost twice the $3,000 per month of income reported by those going into retirement without a financial plan.Bottom LineRetired man taking a walkProjecting the amount of income you'll need in retirement includes factoring in your current living expenses, debt levels, where you'll live, whether you'll downsize your living arrangements and other elements of your desired lifestyle in retirement. To be comfortable, most people will need their own savings and investments as well as their Social Security benefits.Tips on Social SecurityPhoto credit: ©iStock.com/Wirestock, ©iStock.com/ALotOfPeople, ©iStock.com/lucentiusThe post Just 10% of Workers to Wait Until 70 to Take Maximum Social Security Benefits appeared first on SmartReads by SmartAsset.

Text Content: roubleRussia’s central bank has hiked interest rates to 12pc in an attempt to defend the plunging rouble.The increase from 8.5pc to 12pc was announced after an emergency meeting, in a move the central bank said was designed to help “limit price stability risks” and cool inflationary pressures.It is the second increase in just three weeks and the biggest since the war started in Ukraine when Russia hiked rates to 20pc to support the rouble.It comes after the rouble fell to a 16-month low on Monday, slipping below 100 to the US dollar despite the Kremlin’s efforts to prop up its currency.The central bank warned the weaker currency – which makes imports more expensive – was “gaining momentum and inflation expectations are on the rise.”The rouble fell by 2pc after Tuesday’s announcement, weakening to 98.5 against the dollar.In a statement, the central bank said: “Inflationary pressure is building up. As of August, the annual rate of inflation rose to 4.4pc while current price growth rates continue to increase.“The risk of inflation’s deviation upwards from the target [of 4pc] in 2024 is substantial.”The Kremlin has come under increasing pressure from Western sanctions and dwindling oil and gas revenues.The rouble has lost 25pc of its value against the dollar this year as many Russians have also moved their money abroad.Russia’s soaring war budget and slumping energy revenues have pushed the country’s budget deficit close to its 2023 target in just seven months.The gap between tax revenues and government spending grew to $29.3bn (£23bn) in the year to July, up from $28.26bn in the first six months of the year, according to data from Russia’s Ministry of Finance last week.The cost of the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine has soared over the past year, transforming the $5.7bn budget surplus posted in the same period in 2022 into a yawning deficit.The budget deficit is now equivalent to 1.8pc of gross domestic product (GDP), edging closer to its target of 2pc for the whole of 2023.Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

Text Content: Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com has denied speculation that its billionaire founder Richard Liu Qiangdong and his wife Zhang Zetian had emigrated to the US, crushing the latest rumours surrounding the personal life of one of the country's most well-known entrepreneurs.The Beijing-based firm wrote on its Weibo account on Monday that gossip circulating on social media, alleging that the couple had moved to the US or spent more than US$100 million there to buy luxury homes, were fabricated. It added that the company had reported the case to Chinese police.In a letter attached to that post, a lawyer at Beijing-based law firm Jincheng Tongda & Neal, which represents the couple, warned that legal actions would be taken against any parties spreading the "false information", which had "seriously damaged the reputation of Liu and Zhang".Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.The statement comes amid efforts by the Cyberspace Administration of China, the top internet regulator, to quash online misinformation regarding private entrepreneurs and their businesses, in a bid to shore up private-sector confidence.Richard Liu and wife Zhang Zetian. Photo: YouTube alt=Richard Liu and wife Zhang Zetian. Photo: YouTube>Any attempt by a Chinese private entrepreneur to transfer assets to the US or apply for residence permits in foreign countries is usually interpreted by Chinese netizens as a sign of disloyalty to the country.Following media reports last year that Jack Ma, founder of Alibaba Group Holding, had been living in Tokyo for months, the retired business magnate also officially denied that he had migrated to Japan. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.There has been no public evidence showing that Liu and Zhang, who was dubbed "Milk Tea Sister" after an image of her holding a cup of bubble tea as a high school student went viral online, had emigrated to the US or purchased property there.Story continuesHowever, Zhang was said to have bought a four-bedroom, five-bathroom penthouse at Stamford Residences, a luxury apartment building located in the historic Sydney neighbourhood of The Rocks, for US$12 million in 2015, months before her wedding ceremony in Australia. She reportedly sold the flat for US$16 million in 2018.Liu, who founded JD.com in 1998, grabbed headlines in 2018 after a Chinese student at the University of Minnesota accused him of raping her while he was in Minneapolis for a week-long residency as part of the school's doctor of business administration programme.Liu was briefly detained by local police and flew back to China hours after his release. Local prosecutors later decided not to prosecute him, citing lack of evidence. The student then filed a civil suit against Liu, which the two parties settled last year.Liu has since kept a low profile, along with most other Chinese tech moguls.This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

Text Content: As we reach the tail end of the 2Q23 earnings season, it’s time to take stock of the current market landscape and gauge the resilience of equities.To start with, the pace of inflation is falling – but remains above the 2% target. Against a background of inflationary pressures and recessionary fears, the second quarter earnings were stagnant – but while the bar was low, most firms cleared it, beating the expectations.In a recent note, BlackRock’s Global Chief Investment Strategist, Wei Li, has outlined the implications for investors, with a focus on enhancing margins.“U.S. earnings are stagnating. Market expectations of a pickup in margins over the next year look rosy as worker shortages keep pressure on wages… We see inflation on a rollercoaster as the labor shock takes over from the spending mismatch. If companies attempt to safeguard margins against these wage pressures in a stagnant economy, this could contribute to inflation pressures and potentially result in even higher central bank policy rates,” Li opined.Against this backdrop, BlackRock has been buying up dividend stocks. These are the classic defensive plays for a difficult economic situation, and one of BlackRock’s buys is yielding as high as 14%. We’ve delved into TipRanks’ database to see what Wall Street analysts have to say about whether these stocks make compelling investments. Let’s take a closer look.DHT Holdings, Inc. (DHT)We’ll kick off with DHT, a holding company in the global oceanic transport sector. The firm is an independent crude oil tanker company, with a modern fleet of 24 very large crude carriers (VLCCs), the largest oil tankers plying the trade routes today. Only 4 of DHT’s vessels were built before 2011, and all are classed between 299K to 320K deadweight tonnage.On the operational side, DHT manages its fleet through integrated management firms based out of Singapore, Norway, and Monaco. DHT combines a high market exposure with a fixed-income business model based on charter contracts for the fleet.Story continuesDHT’s business model brought in solid income during the last reported quarter, 2Q23. The company’s performance was based on its time charter equivalent earnings that averaged $56,300 per day. This average figure was in turn derived from a $36,200 daily rate for time charters and a $64,800 daily rate for spot market VLCC tanker operations.In the headline numbers, this led to total shipping revenues of $152 million for the quarter, up from $99.2 million in the year-ago period. The company’s adjusted net revenues, of $112.9 million, more than doubled from the $54.1 million in 2Q22, and beat the forecast by $3.2 million. At the bottom line, DHT’s non-GAAP EPS came in at 35 cents, in-line with Street’s expectations.Turning to the dividend, we find that DHT next pays out the common share distribution on August 30, at a rate of 35 cents per share. This annualizes to $1.40 per share, and gives an impressive yield of 14.5%.BlackRock has been busy purchasing DHT stock, picking up 1,731,800 shares in Q2. The investment and asset manager now holds a total of 9,579,402 shares in the shipping company worth over $91 million.DHT also gets the support of 5-star Evercore analyst Jonathan Chappell, who writes: “That 3Q ‘raise’ is the only EPS or dividend estimate change through 2024 as DHT continues to hold costs at a manageable level and as our outlook for the crude tanker markets remains unchanged from our optimistic view for the next 6 months… A seasonal uplift in VLCC rates entering the winter season should act as a catalyst to the shares.”Looking ahead, Chappell sees fit to put an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating on DHT shares, alongside his $13 price target, which implies a 36% one-year upside potential. (To watch Chappell’s track record, click here)Overall, there are 4 recent analyst reviews on file for DHT stock – and they all agree that this is one to buy, making the Strong Buy consensus rating unanimous. The shares are trading for $9.53 and they have an average price target of $13.43, pointing towards ~41% potential gain in the year ahead. (See DHT stock forecast)NewtekOne, Inc. (NEWT)The next stock on Blackrock’s radar is NewTekOne. This technology and financial services firm specializes in partnering with the business world, offering a range of financial solutions tailored to companies of all sizes – from small businesses to larger enterprises. The company offers business banking, financing options for lending, enhanced payment processing, seamless omni-channel POS systems for sales and operations, and even HR and payroll solutions for the workforce. In short, NewTekOne puts all of the finance and technology needs of the modern business into one package.From the enterprise customer perspective, perhaps the most important attributes that NewTekOne offers are less tangible than the revenue-generating services. The company brings with it a proven track record of helping its customers grow their businesses and can draw upon more than 20 years of experience in devising solutions for customer issues.This company started out 2023 on a high note, closing its acquisition of the National Bank of New York City in early January. The acquisition move was announced in August of 2021, and this past December, NewTekOne became a bank holding company as part of the transaction.Working with the business world has worked for NewTekOne. In the firm’s 2Q23 report, the last financial results released, it reported a combination of ‘record deposit growth and loan fundings,’ the twin cornerstones of its business. Total deposits were $447.4 million as of June 30, up 220.6% from December 31, while the total commercial loan closings in Q2 reached $251.2 million, for a y/y increase of 6.4%.The company’s revenue was reported at $52.1 million, missing the forecast by $1.1 million but growing y/y by over 170%. The bottom line, a GAAP EPS of 26 cents, was 2 cents lower than expected; the non-GAAP EPS, however, also 26 cents, came in 9 cents ahead of the estimates. NewTekOne had $256.3 million in cash and liquid assets as of the end of Q2, a total that included $66.7 million worth of restricted cash.On the dividend front, NewTekOne last paid out on July 21 at a rate of 18 cents per common share. This annualized to 72 cents per common share, and gave a yield of 4%, about double the market average.Clearly, BlackRock liked what it saw here in Q2, as the firm opened a new position on NEWT, buying 1,631,088 shares of the stock during the quarter. These shares are now worth ~$29 million.This stock also caught the attention of 5-star analyst, Bryce Rowe, of B. Riley. Rowe likes the National Bank of New York City transaction, and sees it as revenue generator gong forward. He writes, “We continue to consider NEWT to be in the very early innings of its transition from BDC to bank/financial holding company that began with the closing of its acquisition of National Bank of New York City in early January. 2Q23 was the first full quarter as a financial holding company and included highlights of why the transition from BDC to financial holding company makes sense for NEWT, with the most important being the ability to fund its primary loan product [SBA 7(a) loans] with deposits and the ability to fold its payments and technology solutions functions into the operating structure of a bank.”Looking ahead, Rowe adds his outlook for the near future: “We believe NEWT’s valuation has potential to work higher given the asset-light nature of its operating model that is projected to generate a return on assets in excess of 3.0% vs. a projected 2023 average of roughly 1.09% for $5-$50B banks.”To this end, Rowe bumped up his price target on NEWT, from $20 to $21, suggesting the stock will appreciate ~19% in the coming months. Unsurprisingly, his rating here is a Buy. (To watch Rowe’s track record, click here)Some stocks fly under the radar, and NEWT is one of those. There are only two analyst reviews on file here, and they include 1 Buy and Hold, each, all coalescing to a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The shares are priced at $17.71, with an average price target of $20.50 indicating a runway toward ~16% upside for the next 12 months.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- When former postman Iqeel Ahmed told staff at his local Halifax branch he couldn’t feed his family because he was locked out of his account, they asked whether he had tried the nearest food bank.For six weeks after his card was first declined — trying to buy takeaway chicken before a night shift — he’d visit the bank close to his home in Luton, Bedfordshire, in search of answers. The 45-year-old’s salary from the Royal Mail was being deposited, but his direct debits bounced, leaving him unable to pay bills.The Halifax branch manager eventually called and said Ahmed could use his account again if he provided ID. Two months after he regained access, both Ahmed and his wife Iram Khan received letters stating that the bank couldn’t maintain a relationship with them. Savings accounts for his young children were also closed.He was baffled, initially thinking the letters were a scam. He recalls going into the branch on the day his card froze to let them know he would be going on a family holiday to Morocco — a detail that has played on his mind as he’s never received a better explanation of what happened.“You know what they say, there’s no smoke without fire,” he said in an interview. “But when it happens to you, you’re thinking, but I didn’t do anything.” Ahmed is a familiar figure in his community, having volunteered for a homeless charity. After three decades banking with Halifax, Ahmed now advises his friends to open multiple accounts like him and not “put all their eggs in one basket.”A spokesperson for Lloyds Banking Group Plc, which owns Halifax, said they couldn’t comment on individual cases unless they were given the customer’s personal details. “We meet all regulatory and legal requirements and do not close an account, or prevent one being opened, based on a customer’s political or personal beliefs,” they said.Story continuesShut DownSince Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage declared that he’d lost his bank account with NatWest Group Plc’s upmarket Coutts subsidiary in June, the concept of debanking has catapulted into the spotlight. Bank chiefs have insisted they don’t take personal or political beliefs into account when removing access to financial services. NatWest CEO Alison Rose quit after Farage uncovered documents showing that, in his case, the opposite was true.For Muslim communities in Britain, accessing financial services can prove especially difficult. From delays with applying and problems passing screening checks, to sudden debanking without an explanation, Bloomberg News has spoken to numerous customers who have struggled with the system.In early August, the Muslim Council of Britain called for an impartial review of whether banks were closing accounts disproportionately. Figures from the Financial Conduct Authority last year showed about one in fifty UK adults are unbanked — a proportion that rises to one in 10 for Muslims.The government has promised to examine the issue of debanking, both generally and for politicians in particular, who are deemed more of a money-laundering and corruption risk by the banks. Lenders will soon be obliged to give account-holders 90 days’ notice and a reason for cutting them off.To be sure, banks have good reason to be wary of money laundering, which has been regulated globally since the 1990s and subject to even stricter rules after 9/11 to curb criminal money flows. The consequences for not being tough enough can be huge: After a record $1.9 billion fine for facilitating drug cartels in 2012, HSBC Holdings Plc has pulled back from multiple countries and business lines, partly to avoid reputational risk.Read more: NatWest Fined $351 Million After Bin Bags of Cash LaunderedUK lenders have become increasingly keen to close accounts, with almost 350,000 shuttered last year, compared to about 45,000 in 2017, according to FCA data obtained by the Mail on Sunday. Over 1,300 people complained about their account closure to the financial ombudsman last year. Many of those affected get no explanation.This was the case for one NatWest customer who received a letter two months ago, which was seen by Bloomberg, informing them their account would be closed after 14 years.When the person, who asked not to be named discussing their finances, complained about discrimination, the bank wrote it was not willing to reconsider the decision or “divulge the precise reason.” The person said they were told by their banker these decisions are rarely reversed and believed there was little point in complaining to the Financial Ombudsman Service. The account was closed in late July.NatWest, like other banks, declined to comment on individual cases. “Like all UK regulated banking institutions, we are subject to legal and regulatory requirements, and we treat compliance with them as a matter of priority,” a spokesperson said. “This may mean we are required to delay, or refuse to act on a customer’s instructions, and/or restrict, or close a customer’s account.”UK Finance, the trade body, said “the decision to close an account is only taken after extensive review. If a firm concludes that it cannot continue to offer services, it must communicate this to the customer so far as permissible and in every case treat the customer fairly.”Loss of OpportunityWasif Mahmood, a financial services lawyer, deals with numerous debanking cases affecting marginalized communities in Britain, including small business owners and overseas students. Debanking has far-reaching implications for these groups, leading to a vicious cycle of lost opportunities, he said.Among Mahmood’s clients are people with cash-and-carry shops from immigrant, Muslim backgrounds, who banks see as vulnerable to money laundering, he said. Lenders were filing Suspicious Activity Reports like a “sledgehammer to crack a nut” as grounds to shut down accounts, he added.Access to the SAR database is strictly limited to particular law enforcement and government agency staff, and those with a filing against them often aren’t told, in order to avoid the risk of tipping off criminals. Suspicion of money laundering has become a catch-all, said Mahmood, adding that he’s seen the system disproportionately hitting individuals from lower socio-economic backgrounds.In modern Britain, “you are a non-person if you don’t have a bank account,” the lawyer said.‘Risky’ AccountsRestricted banking access for Muslims is not a new issue. In 2014, HSBC faced criticism by rights groups for closing the accounts of Syrian refugees, Finsbury Park Mosque, and the Ummah Welfare Trust, among others. Data provider World-Check apologized and paid £10,000 ($12,753) in damages after wrongly linking the mosque and other individuals to terror activities. The mosque, which was led by radical preacher Abu Hamza until an anti-terrorism raid in 2003, was reopened by new managers who denounced Hamza and worked to rebuild community relations.Islamic Relief, a major aid agency, had its accounts shut by HSBC around that time, two years after its UBS account was closed. “Some banks are reluctant to deal with humanitarian charities working in the world’s most fragile and complex states because it’s simpler to just say no,” said Alun McDonald, head of media and external relations. He said banks needed to invest in due diligence and update risk management to factor in the UN exemption on humanitarian assistance from sanctioned regimes.Anas Altikriti, founder of the Cordoba Foundation think-tank, also received a letter from HSBC saying his current and business accounts, as well as those of his then-wife and teenage sons, would be closed during that period. He opened an account with Lloyds Banking Group Plc, only to find it unusable due to constant phone calls about payments in and out of his account, and it later shut him out too.Over the years, accounts with Banco Santander SA, Halifax, NatWest, and RBS were also closed, he said. In August, he learned his Barclays Plc account had been shut. None of the banks would comment on individual cases.After investigative journalist Peter Oborne looked into his case, Altikriti discovered he was on a heightened risk list compiled by World-Check Risk Intelligence. He believes it’s because of his views about the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Palestinian rights. His father is also a politician in Iraq. As a result, he always has two or three accounts at hand, anticipating closures. Currently, he’s waiting for Wise Plc to verify his details for an account he applied for in May.“These are lives we’re talking about,” Altikriti said in an interview. “I don’t know whether my marriage broke down because of this. I don’t know whether my relationship with clients broke down because of this. I don’t know if my reputation has been sullied as a result of this.”Name CheckIssues also crop up at the beginning of the customer journey. The nine biggest lenders are required to offer free basic accounts under the 2015 Payment Accounts Regulations, allowing all legal residents to receive money and pay bills. Around 7.4 million of these accounts exist, yet there are some examples of difficulties.Nina Mohanty founded Bloom Money, a savings app designed for diaspora communities, in part to address the obstacles faced by such customers in the rest of the financial services industry. Mohanty said there are cases where Palestinian refugees are turned away because banks don’t accept their travel documents, while those with Sudanese passports are rejected because the country is under UK financial sanctions.“It is very much a broken system,” she said.Ibrahim Khan, co-founder of wealth management app Cur8 Capital, said he’s never managed to get an account with Monzo or Revolut and has never received an explanation. He believes it’s due to potential sanction matches with his name, so ran the name he uses for banking through Experian and ComplyAdvantage screens. “You can imagine with a name like Muhammed Khan, you’ll get a fair few hits.”He argued that it highlighted the systemic “racism and bias creep” in screening processes, with algorithms trained on watch lists heavily populated with Muslim, Black, or ethnic minority names. Identity checks that rely on photos also struggle with Black or Brown faces, potentially leading to longer onboarding times and adding a further barrier to access.Read more: Humans Are Biased. Generative AI Is Worse.Khan said financial institutions look at roughly the same live sanction screens. Setting the “fuzziness” wide on searches – like including every possible spelling of “Muhammed” – can trigger false positives. Banks can generally change the settings on their checks to suit their risk appetites.Bloomberg News obtained permission from Khan to ask Monzo about his application. “There are multiple factors that influence decisions on whether to offer someone an account,” a spokesperson for Monzo said. “This decision made in 2021 was not determined by any sanctions or PEP screening and had nothing to do with this person’s name.” They declined to give further information on the reason Khan was rejected.“We have a sophisticated range of ways to screen customers but we can confirm that a customer’s onboarding or offboarding has absolutely nothing to do with their name, race, ethnicity or religion,” Revolut said in a statement.For Husayn Kassai, the co-founder and former chief executive officer of global identity-checking company Onfido, a key source of frustration has been blacklisting and reduced access to finance. “I don’t think the banks are doing enough to think through their internal biases in the system,” he said.Lenders are legally required to shut out certain customers to meet money laundering and terrorism legislation, and serve those who meet the qualifications for “basic” accounts. Beyond that, banks set their own risk tolerance, often in private. Kassai points out the grey areas here, with banks’ strict approach to money laundering compliance in retail accounts in sharp contrast to London’s reputation as a haven for money-laundering among the world’s richest.Institutions are willing to take on greater risks as long as the accounts are “financially lucrative enough,” he said. “Banks have a fundamental duty to the community and must ensure fair and appropriate access to everyone.”©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: When you’re in the market for a home, you’re probably going to get to know a mortgage lender. And they’re going to get to know you — or at least, your finances — inside and out.So, what is a mortgage lender and what role do they play in the homebuying process? Before you make each other’s acquaintance, peruse this primer on how these financing institutions work.What is a mortgage lender?A mortgage lender is a bank or financial company that provides financing that’s related to real estate. Some lenders, like your big retail bank, also offer auto loans, personal loans or student loans; some specialize in mortgages and other home-related loans. They offer funding towards the purchase, construction or improvement of land and property.In short, a mortgage lender provides you with the funds to buy a home. Then, every month you make payments that go towards paying off your loan balance.The real estate in question usually acts as collateral for the loan.You can, and should, shop for different loans at different mortgage lenders to compare loan terms and identify which ones offer the best rates, fees and repayment terms for your situation. Try getting preapproved or prequalified from a few different lenders to see what offers fit best for you.How mortgage lenders workWhen you need a mortgage, a mortgage lender will have you complete an application so it can assess your ability to afford a home loan in general. Based on the information you provide, the lender will decide whether you’re qualified and, if so, set the maximum loan amount it’ll give you and the interest rate it’ll charge on that amount. It will also base these terms on an appraisal to determine the value of the home.The relationship doesn’t necessarily stop after you’ve closed on the mortgage, and receive the funds. The lender either manages the repayment process (including helping you navigate relief options, if it comes to that) or outsources this work to a servicer.Story continuesTypes of mortgage lendersThere are various types of mortgage lenders, from local and regional lenders to big brand-name financial institutions. Lenders can be banks, credit unions or mortgage companies (many of the latter are exclusively on-line companies). The best lenders offer different incentives, such as lower APRs or zero fees. This means you might have a different set of criteria at one lender compared with others when shopping around for the right match.So, what is a mortgage company going to do to get you set up with a home loan? It varies by lender type, so it helps to look more closely at your options.Retail lendersWhen you picture a mortgage lender, you’re probably thinking of a retail lender. Credit unions and banks fall under this category. They’re called retail lenders because, like retail stores, they deal directly with consumers.Direct lendersDirect lenders function a lot like retail lenders, except that while the latter might offer a variety of other products, a direct lender specializes in mortgages. A mortgage bank is one type of direct lender. They’re called direct lenders because they directly originate their own loans.Portfolio lendersPortfolio lenders fund their home loans with their own money, and tend to hang onto them (as opposed to selling them to investors, as other lenders do). As a result, they aren’t subject to some of the underwriting criteria that guides other mortgage lender options. If you need a jumbo or other type of non-conforming loan, for example, a portfolio lender might be right for you.Wholesale lendersIf you get a home loan through a mortgage broker, a wholesale lender might be behind it. These lenders offer the loans they originate through third parties, who interface with the homebuyer; they don’t deal with consumers directly. After closing, many wholesale lenders sell the mortgage on the secondary market and let a different financial institution service the loan.Online lendersThe answer to “what is a mortgage company?” has evolved with the internet. Some financial institutions primarily operate online. You might apply for the loan using an online form rather than by meeting with a loan officer, for example. Because they have less overhead, these digital enterprises may be able to offer lower rates and fewer fees, depending on your eligibility criteria. But you’ll generally get less personal service if you go this route.Warehouse lendersJust like a wholesale lender, warehouse lenders don’t interface with consumers. Instead, they offer the funding other homebuyer-facing institutions and individuals need to get the loan going. Warehouse lenders offer this financing with a tight timeline, and the expectation is usually that the loan will get sold on the secondary market right after closing, at which point the warehouse lender gets repaid.Correspondent lendersCorrespondent lenders originate their own loans, but not with the goal of servicing them. Instead, they generally work with larger lenders who buy the loan after closing. That assumes, of course, that they can sell the loan. If they can’t, the correspondent lender will be the one to service your loan.Hard money lendersHard money loans can usually close quickly with fairly flexible underwriting criteria, but they come with two big downsides. First, you’ll likely need to pay hefty origination fees. Secondly, hard money loans generally need to be repaid quickly (e.g., in a few years). As a result, they may appeal to house flippers but generally aren’t a go-to option for traditional homebuyers.Is it better to get a mortgage from a bank, mortgage company or an online lender?There’s no one right answer to this since every lender offers different features and terms. But the best way is to compare at least three lenders, one of each type, when mortgage-shopping.  Make a decision based on:Next steps for finding a mortgage lenderThere are plenty of mortgage lenders to choose from. Compare banks, credit unions and online lenders to see which ones might be the best mortgage lender for you. Generally, that means they offer the lowest interest rate, fewest fees and most friendly down payment requirements.When choosing a lender, you should also consider factors unrelated to finances. For instance, do you want to be able to visit your lender to talk about your loan in-person? If so, a local bricks-and-mortar bank or credit union might be better for you. If you prefer to use an online lender for easy application and approval, you might not need to look at traditional banks and credit unions.FAQs: Frequently asked questions about mortgage lenders

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Russia may partially reinstate capital controls to stem a slump in the ruble to levels not seen since the start of the war in Ukraine.The proposal to mandate sales of export revenues was discussed at a meeting between the government and exporters on Monday, before the Bank of Russia announced an emergency rate hike, according to four people familiar with the discussions, who asked not to be named because details are private. Two of the people said that no breakthrough was reached and another meeting may be held later this week.The Bank of Russia raised its benchmark rate to 12% from 8.5% on Tuesday after the ruble briefly broke through 100 to the dollar for the first time since March last year. Forced sales of export revenues, along with other measures such as limits on bank transfers of foreign currency, helped to stem the ruble’s slide after the start of the war.Read more: Russia’s Emergency Rate Hike Fails to Lift Ruble After CrashThe ruble appreciated after the rate announcement before reversing gains and is still among the three worst performers in developing economies this year with a loss of about 25%. Without additional measures such as the central bank interventions or mandatory sales of export revenues it may take several months for the ruble to strengthen, according to Sofya Donets, an economist at Renaissance Capital.With much of the central bank’s reserves already frozen by sanctions, policymakers will be reluctant to wade into the currency market with direct interventions.What Bloomberg Economics Says...“The causes of the ruble decline are home-made and have little to do with a capital account shocks, which capital controls are best suited to address. Capital restrictions will also damage nascent supply chains that Russia is trying to build to avoid sanctions.Story continuesAlex Isakov, Russia economistIn recent months Russian exporters have already been selling more than 80% of their revenues on the market, central bank data shows. Governor Elvira Nabiullina said in July that the Bank of Russia is closely monitoring foreign currency sales from the exporters and only 1% of total incomes remains outside of the country.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: This week, more than 800,000 student loan borrowers with billions of dollars in debt will start to have their loans discharged.The one-time account adjustment comes after the Biden administration last month announced it would forgive student loans for 804,000 borrowers with a combined $39 billion in federal student loan debt. These borrowers have been in income-driven repayment (IDR) plans for more than 20 years and "never got the credit they earned" under IDR plans, the White House said in a statement Monday."Hundreds of thousands of borrowers weren't accurately getting credit for student loan payments that should have delivered them forgiveness under income-driven repayment plans," President Joe Biden said in the statement. They "will start to see their student debt canceled" this week.How will I know if my loan is forgiven?Look for an email from your loan servicing company, which began alerting people about the debt forgiveness on Monday, according to ABC News.The Biden administration has targeted borrowers enrolled in IDR plans for forgiveness because of "historical failures" of the system.IDR plans work by calculating monthly repayment sums based on the borrower's income. That payment can be as low as $0 a month, for borrowers who don't earn an income.Student loan borrowers enrolled in an IDR plan should technically be eligible for forgiveness after making either 240 or 300 monthly payments on an IDR plan or a standard repayment plan, according to Department of Education regulations. That includes borrowers with monthly payments as low as $0.However, reviews by the Education Department of IDR payment-tracking procedures "revealed significant flaws" in the system that suggested borrowers were "missing out on progress toward IDR forgiveness," according to a statement from the DOE last year.  In addition, the department's review of Federal Student Aid suggested that struggling borrowers were placed into forbearance by loan servicers, in violation of DOE rules.Story continuesOn July 14, the Department of Education informed borrowers enrolled in income-driven repayment plans who have accumulated the equivalent of either 20 or 25 years of qualifying monthly payments that they would soon receive notices confirming their debt was canceled."For far too long, borrowers fell through the cracks of a broken system that failed to keep accurate track of their progress towards forgiveness,"  U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona said in a statement at the time.The federal relief will completely wipe out student loan debt for more than 614,000 people, according to the White House statement Monday.The Education Department did not immediately reply to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment.Who qualifies for the new student loan forgiveness?While some borrowers in IDR plans are heaving a sigh of relief this week, millions of Americans will soon need to make payments on their student loans for the first time in more than three years.Interest will start accruing on September 1, and loan repayments will begin in October.Roughly 43.5 million Americans have taken on student loans, with the average borrower owing $37,787, Federal Reserve Bank of New York data shows.Biden opened a new student debt repayment plan. Here's what to knowWhat happens if you don't begin repaying your student loans?One-third of graduate schools leave their alums drowning in debtLast year, President Biden announced his administration would cancel up to $20,000 in student loan debt for millions of Americans, a touchstone of his presidential campaign. However, the Supreme Court blocked the administration's plans in June, ending the program before discharges could begin.For those facing repayments that they're thinking of skipping, options exist.One is the new Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan, an income-driven repayment program, which opened in July. The SAVE program was developed as an alternative for borrowers to avoid the pitfalls of traditional IDRs, such as interest that can snowball.The program could cut monthly payments in half or even to $0 for borrowers. Many will save up to $1,000 a year on repayments, according to the Biden administration.

Text Content: A couple looks over their retirement plan while sitting in their kitchen. One of the most important decisions in retirement is choosing how much to withdraw from your savings. You need to take out enough to meet your spending needs, but not so much that you end up running out of money.While there's no real consensus on a safe withdrawal rate, a recent report from Edward Jones has three tips for determining what your ideal withdrawal rate should be in retirement. The financial services firm recommends sticking to a sustainable rate, adjusting it as needed during market volatility and aligning your spending with you personal goals. This method emphasizes the importance of individualized planning and includes specific withdrawal rate recommendations based on your age and risk tolerance.Talk to a financial advisor about your own retirement plan. Find a fiduciary financial advisor today.What to Know About Retirement Withdrawal RatesA popular approach to deciding how much to withdraw from a retirement account employs the 4% rule. This guideline, which was developed in the 1990s, suggests withdrawing 4% from your savings in your first retirement year and then adjusting subsequent withdrawals for inflation. Doing so from a balanced portfolio all but ensures your money lasts 30 years.The 4% rule's creator, financial advisor William P. Bengen, later revised it to 4.7%. Since then, some experts have warned the rule may oversimplify matters and have offered alternative strategies.JPMorgan Chase, for instance, has advised drawing down no more than 2% to 3% of savings each year, citing ongoing inflation, increased life expectancy and prospects for sharply lower returns. JPMorgan suggested considering a number of factors to create a personalized withdrawal strategy, including tax rates, financial commitments, health care expenses and portfolio composition.Morningstar research from 2021 found that a 3.3% initial withdrawal rate was appropriate due to low bond yields and potentially overvalued equity markets. The company has since updated its guidance to 3.8%. Morningstar also evaluated more flexible alternative strategies that include forgoing inflation adjustments, sticking with required minimum distributions (RMDs), creating guardrails for withdrawals and reducing the withdrawal rate by 10% after losses.Story continuesTips for Withdrawals From Edward JonesA retiree smiles while taking a walk. Edward Jones suggests the key is not to pick a single standard rate and stick with it, but to choose one that fits your needs and alter it as your situation and the economic climate shift. The firm offers these three tips to help you find a withdrawal rate:1. First, align your withdrawal rate with your age and risk tolerance: Edward Jones provides initial withdrawal guidance based on age and risk tolerance. These initial withdrawal rates range from as low as 3.0% for a conservative investor in their early 60s to as much as 8.0% for a less conservative 80-year-old.Early 60sLate 60sEarly 70sLate 70s80s and beyond2. Tweak your withdrawal rate when needed: Edward Jones recommends you maintain a flexible withdrawal rate, especially during volatility. For instance, you may need to lower your withdrawal rate or skip annual inflation-adjustment raises during economic downturns.3. Spend according to your goals and values: Reflect on your retirement vision and ensure that your current spending aligns with the goals and values you set for yourself. For example, if you hope to travel extensively in retirement, aim to budget for that while spending beyond your means. Alternatively, you may emphasize contributing to charity. Focus on supporting your main goals and values.Additional ConsiderationsEdward Jones elaborates with additional factors to consider when determining your safe withdrawal rate.Bottom LineA couple reviews their finances and plan for retirement. Determining the right withdrawal rate is a complex process that requires careful consideration of individual needs, market conditions, investment strategies and long-term goals. In calculating a safe withdrawal rate that meets your needs, Edward Jones suggests that it should be appropriate for your age and risk tolerance, market conditions and your goals in retirement.Retirement Planning TipsPhoto credit: ©iStock.com/Anna Frank, ©iStock.com/adamkaz, ©iStock.com/HirurgThe post How Much Should I Withdraw From My Retirement Account?

Text Content: It's always a good sign for stockholders when they see one of the insiders at a company buying shares of company stock. It's well known that insiders may sell shares for dozens of personal reasons that have nothing to do with the company's performance, but generally, insiders are only buyers when they feel the stock price is undervalued and likely to rise over time.It's even more significant when multiple insiders are buying shares of company stock, as that indicates optimism among more than one executive who knows the company's performance best.Such was the case this past week for one real estate investment trust (REIT) in particular, as three different insiders bought thousands of shares of company stock, adding to sizable positions already held.Take a look at the REIT that insiders "agree" is well worth buying near present levels.Agree Realty Corp. (NYSE:ADC) is a Bloomfield Hills, Michigan-based net-lease REIT that focuses on retail properties. Its portfolio includes just over 2,000 properties totaling 42 million square feet in 49 states. Sixty-eight percent of its tenants are investment grade.Agree Realty was founded as Agree Development Co. in 1971. It went public as a REIT on the New York Stock Exchange in 1994 as Agree Realty Corp. Some of its largest tenants include well-known names like Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Best Buy Co. Inc. (NYSE:BBY) Dollar General Corp. (NYSE:DG) and Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR).Three company insiders at Agree Realty recently bought large amounts of Agree Realty stock, as reported on Form 4 of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These were the purchases made:Aug. 2: President and CEO Joey Agree bought 10,000 shares of Agree Realty stock at an average price of $62.79, for a total cost of $627,900. Following the purchase, Agree now owns 539,253 shares of Agree Realty stock.Aug. 2: Director John Rakolta Jr. purchased 30,000 shares of Agree Realty stock at a weighted average price of $63.02 for a total cost of $1.89 million. Rakolta now owns 330,056 shares.Story continuesAug. 2: Richard Agree, a director and executive chairman of the board, purchased 11,750 shares of company stock at an average cost of $62.95, for a total of $739,739. The next day, he added to his total with another purchase of 18,250 shares at an average price of $63.70 for a total of $1.16 million. Agree's now owns 533,290 shares of company stock, although some of them are held indirectly by other family members.On Aug. 1, Agree Realty posted its 2023 second-quarter operating results. Adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) of $0.98 was in line with estimates and was a penny above the second quarter of 2022. Revenue of $129.9 million missed estimates of $130.64 million but was 23.9% higher than revenue of $104.88 million in the second quarter of 2022.The timing of the purchases, occurring after a price drop following the earnings announcement, demonstrates a keen sense of technical acumen. Over the past year, on numerous occasions when Agree Realty shares traded between $62.60 and $63.50, it found strong market support, leading to subsequent increases of several dollars.Like many other REITs, Agree Realty has struggled this year and has a total year-to-date return of negative 8.79%.Agree Realty Corp. pays a monthly dividend of $0.243, with an annual $2.916 dividend that presently yields 4.54%.Analysts are moderately bullish on Agree Realty. On Aug. 2, Stifel analyst Simon Yarmak maintained a Buy rating on Agree Realty and raised the price target from $76 to $76.50. The following day, RBC Capital Markets analyst Brad Heffern maintained an Outperform rating on Agree Realty but lowered his price target from $75 to $74.The stock market is quite complex right now, especially for REITs, as investors grapple with the challenge of determining whether inflation is diminishing slowly, quickly or not at all. It will be interesting to see whether investors also agree with these insiders that now could be an opportune time to purchase shares of Agree Realty Trust.Weekly REIT Report: REITs are one of the most misunderstood investment options, making it difficult for investors to spot incredible opportunities until it's too late.

Text Content: By Amruta Khandekar and Shristi Achar A(Reuters) -Wall Street's main indexes fell on Tuesday after stronger-than-expected retail sales data stoked worries interest rates could stay higher for longer, while U.S. big banks dropped on a report that Fitch could downgrade some lenders.The Commerce Department's report showed retail sales grew 0.7% last month against expectations of a 0.4% rise, suggesting the U.S. economy remains strong.While traders' bets of a pause on hikes by the Federal Reserve next month stayed intact at 89% after the data, analysts said investors were worried that rates could stay at current levels for longer than previously anticipated.Also weighing on markets, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo dropped between 1.8% and 2.4% after a report said ratings agency Fitch could downgrade multiple banks."The story from Fitch about potential downgrades to multiple U.S. banks (is) weighing on sentiment," said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities."You combine that with the retail sales figures this morning that we're a little hotter than estimates, (it) furthers the potential higher for longer rates scenario from the Fed."Shares of regional lenders PacWest Bancorp, Zions Bancorporation and Western Alliance Bank fell between 3% and 6.3% after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp's latest regulatory overhaul proposal.The S&P 500 banking index hit a one-month low, last down 2.2%, while the KBW regional banking index slipped 2.2%.The yield on the 10-year benchmark Treasury note briefly climbed to a near 10-month before edging lower.

By discovering which equites they are leaning into at any given time, investors can piggyback on the decades-long success attained by the stock picking giants.Few are more successful at this game than Ken Griffin, the founder and CEO of hedge fund Citadel and a man with a net worth of ~$34 billion. Last year, against a backdrop of a merciless bear market, Citadel raked in record profits of $16 billion, a testament to Griffin’s and the firm’s market skills.With this in mind, we used TipRanks’ database to find out what the analyst community has to say about two stocks that Griffin’s fund snapped up recently. It turns out that the analyst consensus has rated each a “Strong Buy.” Not to mention solid upside potential is also on the table. Let’s take a closer look.Mobileye Global (MBLY)Griffin has evidently been eying the shift taking place in the auto industry. Mobileye Global is a prominent leader in the realm of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving technology. The firm was founded in 1999, and has since evolved into a globally recognized force, revolutionizing the automotive industry with its cutting-edge innovations. Specializing in the development of vision-based solutions, the company focuses on equipping vehicles with state-of-the-art cameras and sensors that enable a higher level of safety, efficiency, and automation on the roads.Mobileye was snapped up by Intel in 2017 but was spun off last October in a blockbuster IPO. Since then, the company has made a habit of beating bottom-line expectations in its quarterly readouts, a trend that continued in July’s Q2 report.The company delivered adj. EPS of $0.17, beating the Street’s forecast by $0.05. Although revenue experienced a 1.3% year-over-year decline to $454 million, this figure still exceeded the consensus estimate by $3.14 million. Wall Street, however, was not all that impressed, as the company maintained its full-year revenue outlook, anticipating sales to fall within the range of $2.07 to $2.11 billion. The mid-point of this range falls just short of the $2.1 billion expectation set by analysts.Story continuesGriffin, though, must see plenty of value here. His fund opened a new position during the quarter, acquiring 2,415,297 shares. These are currently worth $92 million.Looking at the company’s prospects, it’s the opportunity afforded by Mobileye’s most advanced driver-assist system SuperVision, that informs Canaccord analyst George Gianarikas’ bullish take.“The all-important SuperVision product rollout remains on track, with the company reaffirming its 2023 and 2024 unit estimates and expected inflection point in 2026. While our assumption of 220k SuperVision unit shipments in 2024 remains intact, we suspect some models may have had a higher estimate and not adjusted for the recalibration from 1Q23. The company continues to see strong OEM interest in SuperVision and expects ‘serious engagements’ with many OEMs to mature into additional design win announcements by the end of the year,” Gianarikas noted.“We see Mobileye’s full integrated, system level approach, including REM mapping and RSS, combined with billions of miles of mapping data and close to two decades of R&D, as difficult to surmount long term,” Gianarikas went on to add.Accordingly, Gianarikas rates MBLY stock a Buy while his $55 price target implies one-year share appreciation of 44%. (To watch Gianarikas’ track record, click here)Most analysts agree with that stance. Based on 12 Buys vs. 2 Holds, the stock claims a Strong Buy consensus rating. At $48.85, the average target makes room for 12-month returns of ~28%. (See MBLY stock forecast)Acelyrin, Inc. (SLRN)For our next Griffin-backed selection, we’ll switch lanes and pivot to the biotech space. Acelyrin is a late-stage biopharma focused on developing transformative therapies for patients.The company is a relative newcomer to the stock market, having held its IPO in May of this year. The public listing was an outright success, with the upsized IPO raising $621 million for the company, making it the largest biotech IPO in the US since early 2021.Evidently, the company’s pipeline is turning heads. ACELYRIN is currently working on three drugs, all in various stages of development.Its lead candidate is izokibep, an IL-17A inhibitor being put through late-stage testing as a treatment for hidradenitis suppurativa, uveitis and psoriatic arthritis.Top-line data from the placebo-controlled Part B of the Phase 2b/3 trial of izokibep in hidradenitis suppurativa is anticipated to see the light of day sometime in the third quarter. Additionally, a top-line data readout from the phase 2b/3 randomized controlled trial of izokibep in psoriatic arthritis recently got pushed forward to 1Q24 from mid-2024.Elsewhere in the pipeline, lonigutamab is being developed as a treatment for thyroid eye disease (TED) with top-line results from the ongoing Phase 1/2 Proof-of-Concept (PoC) trial anticipated in late 2023/early 2024.Lastly, the Phase 1/2 PoC trial of SLRN-517 in chronic urticaria (CU) is also taking place right now. Top-line results from this study are expected in the second half of 2024.Griffin has been quick in identifying the potential here, and during Q2, his fund snapped up 6,039,657 shares, which presently command a market value of almost $163 million.With several readouts planned for the pipeline, Piper Sandler analyst Yasmeen Rahimi also has high expectations. “We foresee the company becoming a pioneer in the inflammatory disease space,” Rahimi said. “Beyond an exceptional management team, SLRN is currently developing 3 drugs, which all have validated MoAs: 1) izokibep (IL-17A inhibitor); 2) lonigutamab (anti-IGF-1R); and 3) SLRN-517 (anti-c-KIT). Impressively, each asset has pipeline-in-a-product potential with indication expansion opportunities into additional blockbuster indications. Looking ahead to the next ~year, SLRN has 10 direct catalysts and 25 indirect catalysts, which we believe will be key stock-moving events to ultimately drive shares up.”Up, indeed. Along with Rahimi’s Overweight (i.e., Buy) rating, her $68 price target suggests shares will climb 152% higher over the coming year. (To watch Rahimi’s track record, click here)Overall, SLRN stock has garnered 4 analyst reviews recently and all are positive, making the consensus view here a Strong Buy. The forecast calls for one-year returns of 58%, considering the average target stands at $42.67.

Text Content: By Phuong Nguyen, Francesco Guarascio and Anshuman DagaHANOI/SINGAPORE (Reuters) -VinFast's shares soared in thin trading in their Nasdaq debut on Tuesday following the Vietnamese electric vehicle maker's $23 billion backdoor listing as the startup said it was likely to raise money from global investors within 18 months.The stock opened at $22, more than double the $10 per share agreed with VinFast's SPAC partner Black Spade Acquisition that had valued VinFast at $23 billion.It surged further during the session, ending at $37.06 and valuing the EV maker, which has not posted a profit, at $85 billion, more than Ford's market capitalization at $48 billion and General Motors' $46 billion stock market value.About $185 million worth of the company's shares were exchanged, according to Refinitiv data.The merger with the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) gave Vinfast a listing in a market where founder Pham Nhat Vuong hopes to take on industry leader Tesla with a $4 billion factory under construction and a new approach to sales to bring in dealers.Vietnam's richest man, Vuong is the beneficial owner of 99% of VinFast's 2.3 billion ordinary shares after the merger through his flagship company and affiliates."We have a number of strategic investors and institutional investors lined up. We expect to formulate some kind of capital raising over the next 18 months, for sure," VinFast Chief Financial Officer David Mansfield told Reuters.VinFast has shipped nearly 3,000 vehicles to North America since late last year, but initial sales have been slow. S&P Global Mobility says that only 137 Vinfast EVs had been registered in the United States through June."The Street has all its eyes on the leaders in this next frontier with many winners, along with Tesla, in this green EV tidal wave playing out for the coming years," Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said.VinFast CEO Le Thi Thu Thuy said the company was changing its distribution model, which had been based on Tesla's direct-to-consumer approach, and expected to partner with dealers in overseas markets.Story continues"We are switching to a hybrid model where we have our own showrooms, as well as talking to dealers to open dealer showrooms," Thuy said in an interview with Reuters.VinFast was formed as a unit of Vietnam's largest conglomerate Vingroup. Vuong, Vingroup and affiliates had invested $9.3 billion in the EV maker, according to a June filing. Vuong pledged $2.5 billion in April to bolster the EV maker, including $1 billion from his personal fortune.VinFast's first-quarter revenue dropped 49% from the previous year, and it posted a net loss of $598 million. In 2022, the company posted a loss of $2.1 billion.It has started construction on a $4 billion plant in North Carolina.VinFast is entering the American and European markets at a time when EV pricing is under pressure, led by market leader Tesla and a range of Chinese companies.VinFast's VF8 starts at $46,000 in California, compared with $47,740 for the Tesla Model Y before accounting for a $7,500 federal tax credit on the Tesla.Thuy said VinFast was moving toward "cost reduction in the future."Thuy said VinFast expected to bring its larger VF9 EV to the U.S. market toward the end of the year and was in the process of getting its cars certified by Europe's safety regulator.(Reporting by Phuong Nguyen, Yantoultra Ngui and Jaiveer Singh Shekhawat, additional reporting by Ben Klayman in Detroit and Noel Randewich in Oakland.

Text Content: Financial advisor and columnist Brandon RenfroI am 57 and have $1.1 million in my 401(k) and $50,000 in a high-yield savings account. I earn $300,000 per year and put $30,000 in my 401(k) each year plus a match on the first 6%. I have a $220,000 mortgage on a home valued at $550,000. I would like to retire at 62 with no debt. My wife and I will collect $3,500 each month in Social Security and if I withdraw $5,000 per month from my 401(k), I’ll have a projected positive cash flow of $1,800 each month. My monthly budget includes $1,000 for property taxes and insurance on my home and $1,000 for health insurance until we qualify for Medicare at 65. Is this a good plan? What could I do to make it better besides delaying retirement? -ShaunIt sounds like you’ve worked out your retirement budget and believe that if you follow the plan outlined above you’ll be able to cover all of your expenses and have an extra $1,800 left over at the end of each month. If that’s the case, this plan sounds pretty reasonable on the surface. However, let’s dive a bit deeper into your plan and what you should be thinking about. (And if you have similar questions about your retirement outlook, consider working with a financial advisor.)Sustaining Your Withdrawal RateA man looks over his retirement savings on his laptop. A big issue will be whether or not you can reasonably sustain a $5,000 monthly withdrawal from your 401(k). That will depend heavily on your balance at age 62.I'm not sure about your risk tolerance or how you invest your money so I estimated what your 401(k) balance might be worth by the time you turn 62 using a range of possible returns. You can use your own estimate based on your investment plan.Ignoring the $50,000 in your savings account, let’s assume you have between $1,570,000, and $1,950,000 in your 401(k) by the time you retire. Don't read too much into these numbers, they are just rough estimates that provide us with a range.A monthly withdrawal of $5,000 from a $1,570,000 portfolio equates to a 3.8% annual withdrawal rate. You'll need to decide for yourself based on how much risk you want to take if that works for you, but it's certainly a reasonable number. And if you have $1,950,000 at retirement, withdrawing $5,000 each month means your annual withdrawal rate would barely be 3%, which is even better. (And if you need help calculating your own safe withdrawal rate, consider matching with a financial advisor.)Story continuesScrutinizing Your Cash FlowA couple reviews their retirement with their financial advisor. It also depends on what you mean by positive cash flow. If you were my client I'd be very interested to hear more about your budget with an eye toward whether or not you made adjustments for taxes and recreational spending.Your projected cash flow could potentially be way off if you didn't include the taxes you'll pay on your Social Security benefits and 401(k) withdrawals.Also, you'll want to make sure you account for any lifestyle changes you might experience since retirement doesn't simply mean you no longer go to work. After all, you'll be doing something with your time.I may be taking a leap, but it sounds like you've worked debt payoff into your budget before retirement. Because of that, I didn't think we needed to discuss withdrawing from retirement savings to account for debt payments. Of course, if my assumption is wrong then that will be a big consideration as well. (A financial advisor can help you assess your income needs in retirement.)Next StepsTo improve your plan even more, I'd suggest that you think about planning for unexpected expenses and healthcare, including long-term care. That could involve purchasing a long-term care insurance policy, self-insuring or even involving other family members. There are many ways to plan for these types of expenses. The point is that long-term care and unexpected retirement expenses are too large of a risk to ignore.Tips for Finding a Financial AdvisorBrandon Renfro, CFP®, is a SmartAsset financial planning columnist and answers reader questions on personal finance and tax topics.

Text Content: Poor earnings and analyst downgrades are two negative events that can impact the price of a stock. When a company reports disappointing financial results, it may reflect potential problems with its business operations, a lack of growth or overall financial difficulties. It typically sends investors rushing to the exits.If an influential analyst subsequently downgrades that stock, it stokes even more fears about the overall health of the company. The result: More investors will dump their shares, putting further downward pressure on the stock price.Such was the case the other day with Medical Properties Trust Inc. (NYSE:MPW), a real estate investment trust (REIT) that's struggled for over a year but has now lost even further value following a weak earnings report and a three-level downgrade from a well-known analyst.Medical Properties Trust is a Birmingham, Alabama-based healthcare REIT that owns and operates 444 general acute care and other properties across the U.S. and in nine other countries, with locations in Europe and Australia. It has a portfolio valued at $19.2 billion, of which 64% is general acute care hospitals. About two-thirds of its properties are in the United States.On Aug. 8, Medical Properties Trust reported its second-quarter operating results. Funds from operations (FFO) of $0.48 missed estimates of $0.70, although it was an increase of 4.35% from FFO of $0.46 in the second quarter of 2022. Revenue of $337.39 million also missed the estimates of $351.38 million and was 15.7% below revenue of $400.23 million in the second quarter of 2022.Medical Properties Trust also reported a net loss of $42 million versus net income of $190 million a year ago because of the early termination of five Utah hospital leases and a straight-line rent write-off of $95 million. Forward guidance on FFO was tightened from $1.50-$1.61 to $1.53-$1.57.The weak report caused Medical Properties Trust shares to drop by over 14% in one day, from $10.10 to $8.68. Shares continued to slide over the next two days, ending at $8.13 on Aug. 10. But there was even more pain to come for shareholders.Story continuesCheck out:On Aug. 11, Raymond James analyst Jonathan Hughes downgraded Medical Properties Trust three levels from Strong Buy to Underperform. Hughes cited underperformance in comparison to other healthcare REITs and general REIT average performance. But Hughes had other concerns as well."Improving operator fundamentals have been the lone positive in recent quarters but have been more than overshadowed by growing questions surrounding management communication, credibility, disclosure transparency, operator health, corporate governance, leverage and dividend sustainability," Hughes wrote.It's bad enough when a stock is downgraded one level, like Overweight to Equal-Weight. But a three-level downgrade is a significant negative, and traders reacted the way one might expect — the stock opened down another 5% and touched a low of $7.45 before rebounding to close at $8.08.Wall Street analysts tend to pile on after a prominent analyst downgrades a stock, so it was not surprising that later in the day, Bank of America Securities analyst Joshua Dennerlein also downgraded Medical Properties Trust from Neutral to Underperform and lowered the price target from $9 to $8.Dennerlein's concern, like many analysts, has to do with Medical Property Trust's ongoing exposure to Steward Health Care, its top tenant, as well as its financial relationship with Prospect Medical Holdings Inc., another top tenant.Throughout 2022 and the first three months of 2023, Medical Properties Trust shares experienced a severe decline related to concerns about its relationships with its operators and allegations of a lack of transparency. During this time, Medical Properties Trust was one of the worst-performing REITs, declining 67% from its high of $20.89 in January 2022, to a low of $6.88 in March.The stock rebounded nicely over the next four months, reaching an intra-day high of $10.73 on July 27. But then came the second-quarter earnings report along with the downgrades and all of that changed.With bearish sentiment presently so pervasive and a heavy short ratio of 14.9, it appears that the stock could retest those March lows again. This is a healthcare REIT that could find itself in intensive care for some time to come.Weekly REIT Report: REITs are one of the most misunderstood investment options, making it difficult for investors to spot incredible opportunities until it's too late.

Getty ImagesBerkshire Hathaway (BRK.A)’s quarterly disclosure of its equity holdings is a closely watched regulatory filing for investors as it offers a glimpse of where Warren Buffett sees things go up or down. In the second quarter ending in June, Buffett’s investment conglomerate made new investments in three home construction companies and slashed holdings in General Motors and a few insurance companies, according to an SEC filing yesterday (August 14). Between April and June, Berkshire Hathaway purchased 5.97 million shares of home builder DR Horton worth $726.4 million, 153,000 shares of Lennar worth $17.2 million, and 11,112 shares of NVR worth $70.6 million, the filing shows.Berkshire owns several other home construction and remodeling companies, including Clayton Homes, paint maker Benjamin Moore and insulation material manufacturer Johns Manville. Surging mortgage rates in the past year have discouraged many prospective buyers from entering the housing market and existing homeowners from selling. But new home construction is on the rise and builders are selling houses at a faster pace.Berkshire Hathaway added 2.55 million shares of Capital One, worth $410 million, in the second quarter. It also sold stock. Most notably, it unloaded 18 million shares of General Motors, or 45 percent of Berkshire’s holding in the automaker. The firm reduced stakes in chemical maker Celanese and insurer Globe Life, and closed out its positions in insurer Marsh & McLennan, health care provider McKesson, and oil and gas conglomerate Vitesse Energy. As of June 30, Berkshire’s equity portfolio stood at $348 billion, up from $325 billion at the end of the first quarter.What Berkshire Hathaway bought in Q2:What Berkshire Hathaway sold in Q2:Story continuesTrending Observer StoriesRead the original story Warren Buffett Sees Growth in Home Construction, Slashed GM Holdings and others by Sissi Cao at Observer.

Text Content: By Summer Zhen and Laura MatthewsHONG KONG/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Chinese fears of a spillover from missed payments on some shadow banking linked trust products and worsening consumer sentiment are expected to hasten a policy response to revive the country's cash-starved property sector.Concerns about the outsized exposure of China's $3 trillion shadow banking sector, roughly the size of Britain's economy, to property developers and the wider economy, have grown over the past year as the sector lurched from one crisis to another.Zhongrong International Trust Co, which traditionally had sizable real estate exposure, has recently missed repayments on some investment products, fuelling contagion fears.Trust firms operate outside many of the rules governing commercial banks and mainly channel the proceeds of wealth products sold by banks to real estate developers, other sectors, and even some retail investors.Barclays said in a note that regulators were likely to step in if the market environment deteriorates significantly, and measures used by China in the past to deal with spiking financial volatility have included liquidity injections."The risk of a systemic shock to the Chinese financial system is not great, but the downward pressure on the economy will intensify," said Yan Wang, chief emerging markets and China strategist at Alpine Macro."These issues are all related, thus the contagion is already happening, and the risk of further spread is material. The government needs to act promptly and aggressively to contain the risk," he added.Beijing took a step in that direction on Tuesday by cutting key policy rates after a broad array of data highlighted intensifying pressure on the economy, mainly from the property sector.The latest challenge came from the shadows, with two companies saying over the weekend they had not received payment on maturing Zhongrong International Trust investment products.Story continuesNomura said a wave of defaults on trust products could cause "substantial ripple effects" for China's broader economy as losses suffered by individual investors, lured by higher returns, would have an acute impact on consumption."This is something where the problems are probably not going to be confined to this individual trust but are going to spread to or become more evident in the trust industry as a whole," said Arthur Kroeber, partner and head of research at Gavekal in New York."I think they're within the ability of the government to manage without any sort of dramatic explosion or blow up. But it's a long, slow-burning problem."Even as China's property problems have torn through the economy in the last few years, Beijing has so far managed to contain the impact on the financial industry.'CONTAGION'The trust sector had been a major fundraising channel for property developers seeking rapid expansion. But since 2021, when real estate slipped into a downturn, some of them have gone bust, while others have divested investments in property firms.Beijing has also ramped up efforts since 2017 to reduce the size of the shadow banking sector amid concerns over financial stability. As of end-2022, assets held by trust firms totalled 21 trillion yuan, down about 20% from end-2017.The outstanding value of trust products invested in the property sector was 1.2 trillion yuan as of end-2022, down about 30% year-on-year. Still, exposure to the real estate sector varies from different trust firms."The real contagion may just be what we are already seeing - weak consumer and business confidence which is dragging down growth. The government is well aware of this but has so far been very timid in its response," said Kamil Dimmich, partner and portfolio manager at North of South Capital LLP, in London.Barclays said since trust product clients tend to be wealthy individuals or companies, the authorities may have some "tolerance for market forces to play out".Rayliant Quantamental China Equity ETF co-portfolio manager Phillip Wool said the rise in defaults by trust firms would result in another hit to confidence, as home buyers will not feel comfortable putting down a big down payment."As for whether Beijing steps in, I think we're getting to a point where that has to happen. The deeper confidence sinks, the harder that is to reverse," Wool added.(Reporting by Vidya Ranganathan in Singapore, Summer Zhen in Singapore, Laura Matthews and David Randall in New York, Ziyi Tang in Beijing; Editing by Sumeet Chatterjee and Alexander Smith)

But according to "Shark Tank" star Kevin O'Leary, it's not all sunshine and rainbows."The S&P 500 employs 40% of America," he told Fox Business' Larry Kudlow in a recent interview. "Where the cracks are starting to show is in mainstream America where the car loans have gone from five and a half percent to nine and a half percent and continue to go up."The U.S. Federal Reserve has implemented aggressive interest rate hikes to combat rampant inflation. As a result, many borrowers now face substantially higher loan and mortgage payments.O'Leary noted that lending has slowed down and the cost of borrowing for small businesses has gone up."If you’re a regional bank right now, you’re not lending... I deal with this every day with small business. It’s not good for small business," O'Leary said, adding that "some cracks are starting to show" in regional banks as well.Check out:Where The War Will Be FoughtAccording to O'Leary, the Fed might not be done with its rate hikes because inflationary pressures still exist.In particular, he questioned the amount of money the U.S. will print in light of the spending in the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS Act."That money has not been deployed yet, Larry, that’s close to a trillion dollars," he said. "Whether you think printing money helps or hurts inflation — I personally think it increases inflation — that’s why it’s staying up there."Moreover, the price level of many necessities remains elevated. O'Leary pointed out that energy and food inflation "just won't go away."Story continuesIt's not a good look politically."If you’re the incumbent in the White House, and you got high gas prices coming back up to four bucks, and protein, whether it’s chicken or beef or pork is going back up again, that’s not so great as you’re going into an election cycle. So that’s where the war is going to be fought," O'Leary said.Another reason why the Fed might continue to hike rates is the strength in the U.S. labor market. According to the latest jobs report, the unemployment rate for July was 3.5%, nearing a multi-decade low. Average hourly earnings increased 0.4% for the month.Opportunity AheadHigh borrowing costs, coupled with persistently elevated price levels, do not bode well for the economy. But according to O'Leary, there's a group of companies that stand to benefit from the government's massive spending bills."Where is [the money] going? All into the S&P 500," he said. "So if you’re an S&P 500 company, you’ve got clear sailing for the next three to four years."If you share O'Leary's view and want to invest in the S&P 500, there are many exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that provide convenient access to the group.For instance, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) was launched in 1993 and now has $418.8 billion in assets under management. It tracks the price and yield performance of the S&P 500 Index and has an expense ratio of 0.0945%.Investors can also look into similar ETFs from other issuers, such as the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) and the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO). These two funds have expense ratios of 0.03%.To be sure, while the benchmark index showed impressive gains in 2023, it's not always smooth sailing. Last year, the S&P 500 tumbled 19.6%.If you don't like that kind of volatility, you might want to look into reliable income plays outside the stock market — such as investing in rental properties with as little as $100 while staying completely hands-off.Read next:Don't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Billionaire Kelcy Warren’s Energy Transfer LP will buy Crestwood Equity Partners LP in a $7.1 billion all-equity deal that will create a major expansion of its pipeline networks across the US.The deal will extend Energy Transfer’s position in the Williston basin of Montana and North Dakota and the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, while providing entry into Wyoming’s Powder River Basin, according to a statement Wednesday. Crestwood’s system includes about 2 billion cubic feet a day of gas gathering capacity and 340,000 barrels a day of crude oil gathering capacity.Shares of Energy Transfer were about 2% higher as of 10:19 a.m. in New York, and and Crestwood was up about 5%.The US energy sector has seen dealmaking heat up after booming profits in recent years left producers flush with cash. Pipeline operators have been part of the activity as the transition to renewable energy makes it unlikely that major new infrastructure will be built even as demand for offtake remains robust as shale producers seek to preserve top-quality drilling locations. In May, Oneok Inc. agreed to buy Magellan Midstream Partners LP in an $18.8 billion cash-and-stock transaction that’s awaiting shareholder approval.Read More: Oil Patch Is Poised for Buyout Wave as US Drillers Seek New LandWarren, 67, has been on a buying spree for more than three years. Even before Wednesday’s announcement, he’d committed more than $11 billion to snap up pipelines and ancillary assets in the Permian region, the Gulf Coast and Great Plains. The value of pipeline networks has continued to increase amid the need to connect remote wells to population centers and export facilities.Story continuesThe Crestwood deal includes the assumption of $3.3 billion of debt, according to the statement. Under the terms of the deal, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter, Crestwood common unitholders will receive 2.07 Energy Transfer common units for each Crestwood common unit. After closing, Crestwood common unitholders are expected to own about 6.5% of Energy Transfer’s outstanding common units.“We view the deal as neutral for ET,” Elvira Scotto, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in a report. “ET units are likely to underperform given the all-equity deal.”BofA Securities acted as sole financial adviser to Energy Transfer and Kirkland & Ellis LLP was legal counsel. Intrepid Partners LLC and Evercore acted as financial advisers to Crestwood and Vinson & Elkins LLP was legal counsel.(Adds analyst comment in seventh paragraph)©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: By Jonathan Stempel(Reuters) - Allstate agreed to pay $90 million to settle a class action lawsuit by shareholders who accused the insurer of defrauding them by concealing that it lowered underwriting standards to boost growth.A preliminary settlement was filed on Monday in federal court in Chicago, and requires a judge's approval.The lawsuit came after Allstate on Aug. 3, 2015, reported unexpectedly high claims payouts from auto accidents, causing a larger-than-expected 38% decline in quarterly operating profit.Allstate's share price fell 10.1% the next day, wiping out $2.8 billion of market value.Shareholders said Allstate had falsely assured earlier in the year that claims had been increasing because of factors beyond its control, such as the economy and weather.They said the stock fell after it became clear that loosened underwriting standards were the cause.The Northbrook, Illinois-based insurer denied wrongdoing, but settled to avoid the burden, cost and uncertainty of litigation, according to the settlement.Allstate did not immediately respond on Wednesday to a request for comment. Its main auto insurance rivals include State Farm, Geico and Progressive.The lawsuit is led by pension and annuity funds associated with the Carpenter Funds of Oakland, California.Their law firms plan to seek up to $22.5 million from the settlement for legal fees and up to $4.6 million for expenses.Shareholders may recover an average 46 cents per share if a judge approves the fee and expense request.The case is In re Allstate Corp Securities Litigation, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois, No. 16-10510.(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; editing by Jonathan Oatis)

Text Content: This article was first featured in Yahoo Finance Tech, a weekly newsletter highlighting our original content on the industry. Get it sent directly to your inbox every Wednesday. Subscribe.Nvidia (NVDA) will report its second quarter earnings after the closing bell next Wednesday, setting up what will be the AI hype cycle’s biggest test yet.During this AI gold rush, companies around the world looking to profit have turned to Nvidia’s graphics processors to power new AI software and platforms.Currently, tech firms of all sizes are doing everything they can to get their hands on Nvidia chips. During Tesla’s (TSLA) Q2 earnings call, CEO Elon Musk told analysts that the automaker will take as many Nvidia graphics processors as the company can produce.That kind of demand is also why Nvidia blew away Wall Street’s expectations for its Q2 guidance during its last earnings call. At the time, analysts were anticipating revenue of $7.2 billion, but Nvidia said it will bring in around $11 billion in the quarter — a 64% jump over a year ago — which Wall Street analysts now expect next week.The Street also expects earnings of $2.07 per share, a 306% year-over-year increase. Nvidia is used to enormous numbers, but these are putting high expectations on next week’s report, and the stock is already rising.Jensen Huang, CEO of NVIDIA, speaks during a press conference at the Computex 2023 in Taipei on May 30, 2023. (Photo by Sam Yeh / AFP) (Sam Yeh/AFP via Getty Images)“What Nvidia reports in its upcoming earnings release is going to be a barometer for the whole AI hype,” explained Forrester analyst Glenn O’Donnell. “I anticipate that the results are going to look really outstanding because demand is so high, and that means Nvidia is able to command even higher margins than it would otherwise.”But those sky-high expectations mean if the company doesn’t deliver, it could put a serious damper on the AI explosion and send a shock through AI trades ranging from Microsoft and Google to Meta and AMD.Wall Street is all-in on NvidiaAt the start of trading in New York on Tuesday, Nvidia’s stock hit $445. Year to date, shares of the company are up a staggering 204%. And Wall Street analysts are still upgrading the stock.Story continuesIn a research note Tuesday, Aaron Rakers at Wells Fargo increased his price target on Nvidia from $450 to $500. Baird’s Tristan Gerra moved his price target on the stock from $475 to $570, adding that “AI demand is surging at all levels: individuals, enterprise, hyperscalers.”Morgan Stanley’s Joseph Moore offered a similarly rosy view of the company, writing in a research note that “NVIDIA remains our Top Pick, with a backdrop of the massive shift in spending towards AI, and a fairly exceptional supply demand imbalance that should persist for the next several quarters; we think the recent selloff is a good entry point.”UBS’s Timothy Arcuri also raised his price target on Nvidia, writing in a note that the company is “quite literally serving as ‘kingmaker’ as a huge wave of capital and new financing vehicles are chasing new AI software and specialized cloud infrastructure models.”Nvidia is the preeminent maker of both the high-powered graphics chips needed to run AI programs and the software needed to develop those AI platforms. And the company has been preparing for this moment for years, researching and working on its AI capabilities well before Wall Street jumped into the AI craze with the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT generative AI platform in late 2022.Since then Microsoft (MSFT), Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), and a cadre of AI-adjacent companies have positioned themselves as AI powerhouses.Nvidia is mighty, but not invincibleWhile Nvidia is helping to drive the AI train, it’s facing a major problem at the moment. It simply can’t deliver as many chips as its customers want.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) is Nvidia’s go-to for building its chips, but the manufacturer’s capacity is stretched as orders continue to pile in from Nvidia. According to Arcuri’s note, the recent demand spikes have pushed lead times for Nvidia’s critical H100 chips to six to nine months.During Tesla’s earnings call Musk said Nvidia has too many customers vying for its products. And while the company has prioritized some of Tesla’s orders, Nvidia can’t provide as many chips as the electric automaker requires. As a result, Tesla is building its own supercomputer using its own AI chips to meet its needs.Nvidia isn’t just facing increased lead times for its AI products, but it’s also looking to keep competitors Intel and AMD off its back. While the company has built up a lead thanks to its early investments in AI, the semiconductor business is notoriously competitive, and, as Intel has shown, no industry lead is safe.“Nvidia is not invincible,” O’Donnell said. “Other companies like AMD and Intel and so on could come along and will come along and steal some of that share. But Nvidia has so much momentum right now that it is going to be hard to stop them. Not impossible, but hard.”Now we just have to see what Nvidia has up its sleeve when it reports its earnings on Aug. 23.Daniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

Text Content: The largest climate investment in US history has dramatically reshaped the EV landscape.One year ago, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) into law, which set aside roughly $400 billion in federal funding for clean energy. Since then, carmakers and suppliers have announced more than $62 billion in investments in EVs, according to Bank of America research.New clean energy projects announced have resulted in more than 86,000 reshoring and foreign direct investment manufacturing jobs while jobs related to EVs grew by 27%, more than 17 times that of gasoline and diesel vehicle jobs, according to data compiled by Bank of America."[There’s] something like a trillion-dollar shift from the federal government to the auto industry and the consumer," Tom Narayan, RBC Capital Markets lead global autos analyst, told Yahoo Finance. "All of these OEMs are trying to jump on this and capture and we're seeing that momentum already take place."This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Since the law’s passage, Hyundai has poured billions of dollars into two new gigafactories in Georgia to build electric vehicles. BMW has announced a $1 billion investment to retool its South Carolina facility for EV production, along with a $700 million investment to build an electric battery plant nearby. And earlier this year, Toyota upped its investment in its North Carolina battery plant to nearly $6 billion, making the Liberty facility the largest single economic development project commitment in the state’s history."There’s a 10-year runway and frankly a lot of the hope is that we are subsidizing the learning by doing [it] early on, climbing the learning curve and sliding down the cost curve," Gernot Wagner, a climate economist at Columbia Business School, told Yahoo Finance. "Then it’s a runaway train that, yes, runs on clean electricity."EV tax creditsThe electric vehicle tax credit, which is aimed in large part at weaning US reliance on China, has been the primary driver supercharging these investments.Story continuesThe IRA requires that half of the value of battery components be produced or assembled in North America to be eligible for a $3,750 credit. For an additional $3,750 credit, 40% of the value of critical minerals must also be sourced from the US or a free trade partner.It explicitly bans carmakers from using battery components "manufactured or assembled by a foreign entity of concern," referring to non-allied countries including China, starting in 2024.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.The strict requirements and existing dependence on sourcing critical components from China have limited qualification to roughly a dozen EV models so far, including the Tesla Model 3 (TSLA) and Model Y. But the potential for a credit of up to $7500 per new vehicle has spurred carmakers to realign their supply chains for the long term.When the law was first signed, some electric vehicle makers, including startup Fisker (FSR), criticized the threshold to qualify for federal tax credits.Fisker CEO Henrik Fisker questioned the effectiveness of strict sourcing and manufacturing guidelines that explicitly favored North America, saying that they would "slow down the adoption of EVs" by limiting options for consumers.Yet, in his company’s first Product Vision Day earlier this month, Fisker went onstage, touting US manufacturing of his upcoming vehicles and the price reductions they would enjoy under IRA incentives."They have to be built here in the US because we want to take advantage of the incentives," Fisker told Yahoo Finance, referring to the company’s electric pickup truck and SUVs. "We are looking at a couple of options."President Joe Biden drives a Cadillac Lyriq through the showroom during a tour at the Detroit Auto Show, Sept. 14, 2022. (Evan Vucci/AP Photo, File)Additional production credits in the IRA for battery cells and battery modules produced in the US have only sweetened the deal for producers, Narayan said."A Chevy Equinox could be sold retail pre-credit for $30,000. You and I could get it for $20,000 at the same profitability," said Narayan, adding that American firms like General Motors (GM), which recently opened its Ultium battery factory in Ohio, have been the biggest beneficiaries. "Everybody needs to build the cells locally in North America to qualify to get the $7,500 and the $35 credit which completely more than offsets that capital expense of $2.6 billion per plant [for] GM."Roughly half of all investment dollars stemming from the IRA have gone to EVs and batteries, resulting in an expanded annual battery production capacity of more than a million batteries, according to research from Bank of America.While analysts say the direct impact of tax credits on EV adoption is too early to measure, sales of zero-emission vehicles have continued to see an uptick. Nearly 300,000 new EVs were sold in the second quarter, setting a new record in the US, according to a report by Cox Automotive. That marked a 48.4% increase from the same period last year."There's a lot of taxpayer money to help out with this," Morningstar US autos equity analyst David Whiston said. "You're already seeing that when Tesla started with the initial 20% price cut on model Y and then they've kept going with that with further cuts.""There are people that probably would have normally bought a combustion model this year [saying], 'You know what? I'm gonna go electric and get that model Y,'" Whiston added. "And the model Y is driving a huge chunk of the EV market gains in the US."Akiko Fujita is an anchor and reporter for Yahoo Finance.

The government has seen its support among voters decline, while the far-fight Alternative for Germany party has soared in the polls.Asked about the bill at a separate news conference Wednesday, SPD Health Minister Karl Lauterbach said he was sure the cabinet would approve it on Aug. 30 at a special retreat in Meseberg.He highlighted the complexity of the measures and said he expected the final result to be “a better law.”©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: By Akash Sriram and Paul LienertDETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors is investing in a Silicon Valley startup to help it speed development of a more affordable battery chemistry for its future electric vehicles, the company said on Wednesday.GM will lead a $60 million investment in Mitra Chem, a two-year-old Mountain View, California, company that uses artificial intelligence to accelerate development of lithium-ion battery materials.Mitra Chem will help the automaker develop advanced iron-based cathode active materials such as lithium manganese iron phosphate (LMFP) that could be used in some of GM's next-generation Ultium batteries after 2025.Lithium iron phosphate (LFP) and manganese-enriched LMFP are less expensive, more sustainable alternatives to the nickel-cobalt-manganese (NCM) mixture used in many current EV battery cathodes. Iron-based batteries typically do not store as much energy, however.LFP battery cells were developed in the United States, but Chinese companies such as BYD and CATL currently dominate global production.The new funding round for Mitra Chem “is a strategic investment that will further help reinforce GM’s efforts in EV batteries (and) accelerate our work on affordable battery chemistries like LMFP,” said Gil Golan, GM vice president of technology acceleration and commercialization.The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act “is one of the main drivers” in GM’s efforts with Mitra Chem and others to build a U.S.-based supply chain for LFP batteries and next-generation materials, Golan said.The IRA provides incentives for battery materials, components, cells and packs that are sourced in North America.Golan said batteries made from iron-rich materials developed with Mitra Chem could appear in some GM vehicles in the second half of the decade. He said GM already uses LFP batteries in its electric vehicles in China.GM’s Ultium batteries now use cells with nickel-cobalt-manganese-aluminum cathodes, which store more energy and enable longer driving range than LFP cells, but are more expensive.Story continuesThe automaker has indicated its Ultium joint-venture battery plants with partner LG Chem in Ohio, Tennessee and Michigan will produce cells with NCMA cathodes, while a fourth U.S. plant with Samsung SDI will make “nickel-rich” battery cells.The basic ingredients in LFP and LMFP cathodes are relatively more abundant than nickel and cobalt and tend to be less volatile, battery experts say.Mitra Chem was cofounded by Vivas Kumar, chief executive officer; Will Chueh, chief scientific adviser, and Chirranjeevi Gopal, chief product officer.(Reporting by Akash Sriram in Bengaluru and Paul Lienert in Detroit; Editing by Matthew Lewis)

Text Content: US stocks wobbled in midday trading Wednesday as a retail-heavy week continued with a warning from Target (TGT) and Wall Street digested minutes from the Federal Reserve's which revealed "most" officials still see upside risks to inflation.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was roughly down about 0.2%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) was down 0.4%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was down 0.8%. The indexes were looking to rebound from a day that saw each lose more than 1%.Target took center stage Wednesday morning as the retailer slashed its full-year profit outlook and issued a warning about general economic malaise. The company cited rising interest rates and uncertainty from the restart of student loan repayments as factors that may continue to affect its bottom line. However, the stock jumped more than 3% at the open as it revealed a profit jump.In the afternoon, minutes from the Fed showed most officials still see upside risks to inflation while a "couple" officials didn't want to raise rates in July. The central bank raised interest rates to their highest point since 2001 at that meeting. Investors will look for any clues to what the Fed might do at its meeting next month. At this point, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool, over 90% of traders expect the bank to hold steady.

Text Content: By Isla BinnieNEW YORK, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Invenergy Renewables, Blackstone and Canada's second-largest pension fund said on Wednesday they struck a deal with Bank of America to help buy wind and solar plants worth $1.5 billion, capitalising on a new tax structure included in President Joe Biden's landmark climate law.Developers and investors are working on ways to take advantage of a provision in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act(IRA) which gives companies tax breaks for funding the clean energy projects which can help wean the world off fossil fuels.Invenergy said in a statement it agreed to sell tax credits worth $580 million to Bank of America, and put those funds towards buying 14 projects from American Electric Power.Policymakers hope the new system will bring more money from fresh sources into renewables projects which have long relied on a limited group of large banks which can handle the process of buying equity stakes and taking the associated tax breaks.This is the first large-scale transaction of its kind to be publicly announced, Bank of America's global head of sustainable finance Karen Fang said in the statement.It "creates a financeable transferability product that will be used to scale the growth of renewable energy," Fang said.Around $4 trillion will need to be spent on clean energy development globally each year by 2030 to allow the world's economies to cut greenhouse gas emissions to net zero, meaning no more than can be captured by natural sinks like forests or using technology, the International Energy Agency said.Analysts at investment bank Credit Suisse have estimated the IRA could lead to the generation of tax credits worth $576 billion by 2031.Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service published rules on how to regulate tax credit transfers in June, and they are expected to launch an online registry by the end of 2023.Private equity firm Blackstone has invested around $4 billion in Invenergy. Its fellow investors include Canada's Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec. (Reporting by Isla Binnie Editing by Marguerita Choy)

Text Content: Everybody’s cards are finally on the table.Prosecutors have been contemplating a wide range of charges against former President Donald Trump, and they’ve now filed most or all of them in four separate criminal cases. Economists and political analysts are now trying to figure out what it all means to the country as Trump continues his 2024 presidential campaign — with some unsettling possibilities.“The economy may be far more vulnerable as the 2024 race gets underway,” Bernard Baumohl of the Economic Outlook Group wrote to clients on Aug. 15. “We can’t rule out anything, not massive social unrest, not a crippling cyber attack against the US to sway the election, or even political operatives using artificial intelligence to create disinformation and distort reality on an unprecedented scale. Can the US economy withstand such mayhem?”Normally, markets tune out the vicissitudes of a presidential election, especially more than a year in advance. As Election Day nears, markets may begin to price in the odds of one candidate or the other winning, if it might involve major policy changes involving taxes, regulation, or something else that affects stock prices and economic growth. Markets jumped after Trump’s surprise win in 2016 because tax cuts Trump had promised suddenly seemed more likely.But there’s no template for the 2024 presidential election.Would he strike a deal to stay out of jail? Republican presidential candidate and former U.S. President Donald Trump at the Iowa State Fair. (Evelyn Hockstein/REUTERS)Trump, who’s leading the GOP field by a mile, is a defendant in four criminal trials: one in New York City, two under federal special counsel Jack Smith, and the latest led by the Fulton County, Ga. district attorney. Everything about Trump’s 2024 candidacy is unprecedented: the criminal charges, Trump’s unflagging popularity within his party, and, not incidentally, the chutzpah of the candidate.Trump’s trials could kick off in the first half of 2024. Judges can agree among themselves to sequence them so one doesn’t overlap with the others, which means some of the trials will probably go on well after the 2024 election. The matrix of outcomes is intriguing. Here are four ways it could go:Story continuesTrump quits the campaign. Trump insists he'll see the 2024 election through, but the personal strain of managing four criminal trials seems certain to test even the indefatigable Trump. Many political analysts say there’s no way Trump will be able to run a coherent campaign while constantly huddling with lawyers and flying to court appearances in four different venues.He may not have to run a normal campaign. It’s well known by now that Trump benefits more than any candidate in memory from the media circus that surrounds him. He’ll be the focus of attention whether he shows up at debates or not. His outlandish statements will keep him in the news and his 63% approval rating within the Republican party is a formidable bulwark against other candidates.[Drop Rick Newman a note, follow him on Twitter, or sign up for his newsletter.]Trump runs short of money. Assuming he stays in, Trump could run short of the money needed to run a modern presidential campaign. Trump’s main super PAC is already bleeding because it’s funding much of the legal defense for Trump and others charged with him. This isn’t the money used to run normal campaign operations, which comes from small donors subject to donation limits. That funding seems solid, especially since the Trump indictments have, paradoxically, been a fundraising boon for Trump. Super PACs, however, provide much of the funding for media ads and campaign activities deemed crucial to win.Could Trump win without that? Maybe, at least in the Republican primaries. But a sharp funding shortfall in the general election would be a stark liability against what is sure to be a well-funded Democrat. Super PAC money can be crucial for targeting swing voters in tossup states with messaging that persuades them to vote in the first place, and vote for the preferred candidate. Democrats may already have an edge because their voters are fired up about abortion rights and eager to vote. Trump would need plenty of money to counter that.Trump bows out as part of a plea deal. This would probably only be plausible in one of the two federal cases. Jack Smith, the federal prosecutor, hasn’t suggested any interest in such a deal, and it would certainly give Trump even more fuel for his claim that the federal charges against him are politically motivated.But that logic doesn’t hold up. Biden’s chances of winning in a general election would probably be better against Trump than against somebody younger, fresher, and untarnished by scandal. For Trump, on the other hand, his 2024 presidential bid is a potential bargaining tool. He might be willing to stand down if it allows him to evade a possible guilty verdict and a prison term.Conservative cred: Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin. (Ann Wang/REUTERS)If Trump withdraws, the whole outlook changes. “If there is no Biden or there is no Trump, that would be an immediate market-moving event,” David Kotok, chief investment officer at investing firm Cumberland Advisors, wrote in an Aug. 13 newsletter. A Trump withdrawal would do two things on the Republican side: Lift some of the other candidates already running, and open a door for new contenders to jump in.Some Republicans have been hoping Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis could be the party’s Trump-slayer, but DeSantis has actually lost ground to Trump since entering the race in May. His stiff personality and obsession with “woke culture” seem to leave voters cold, and big donors deeply disappointed. DeSantis might not get much of a bump if Trump departs.Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin could promptly enter the race. Youngkin has earned conservative cred by fighting some of the same culture war issues as DeSantis, with a softer edge and less Trumpiness. Youngkin might have a better shot beating Biden or another Democrat in the general election.Trump hangs in there and becomes president, again. Needless to say, this is the craziest scenario. Trump has broadly hinted he’d pursue an agenda of retribution against his enemies and try to gut key elements of the US government. He's far less focused on economic issues such as trade deficits or taxes this time around.Trump could probably pardon himself if he's been convicted in either of the two federal cases, or order his Justice Dept. to withdraw all charges if they're still ongoing, and close the cases down. He can't do that with the New York City or Georgia case, since the president doesn't have jurisdiction over those. But a second Trump presidency would undoubtedly be an epic battle for the survival of the US justice system. If Trump impaired US legal standards in ways that affected market transparency, it could have devastating consequences for financial assets and growth.There's also uncertainty on the Democratic side. Whoever the Republican nominee is, Joe Biden is his presumed challenger. But Biden isn’t a lock, either. First is the possibility of a health scare, given that Biden is 80. Also keep in mind Biden said his rationale for running in 2020 was to save America from Trump. If Trump were out of the picture, Biden might be more tempted to contemplate retirement.There’s also the chance Biden does plan to drop out, but just hasn’t announced it yet. That would make sense, since the moment a president is no longer running for reelection he becomes a lame duck with diminished political power. If Biden does plan to drop out, he’d have to do so soon if he wants to leave an ample on-ramp for other candidates to prepare for the Democratic primaries, which start in early February of 2024.That might be cutting it close, but in this election season, anything is possible.Rick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Target Corp. shares clawed back some of their recent losses after a surprising profit surge in the second quarter overshadowed the company’s increasingly cautious outlook on the rest of the year.Adjusted earnings more than quadrupled during the quarter ended in late July, Target said in a statement Wednesday, reflecting the retailer’s progress in paring the bloated inventories that forced deep markdowns a year ago. The profit gain crushed Wall Street’s estimates and took the sting out of a sales decline, Target’s first in four years, and a cut to its annual profit forecast.The upbeat second-quarter performance underscored Target’s ability to navigate a slump in discretionary-goods purchases as consumers channel more spending to services and essentials. For a company that has been getting hammered in the stock market since early 2022, that counted as good news even as Target cautioned that it still faced significant headwinds.The results fit a common recent pattern in retail, showing continued consumer resilience in reported quarters even as companies express caution about the future. Home Depot Inc. on Tuesday reported a second-quarter comparable-sales decline that was better than analysts had feared, but the hardware giant maintained the full-year outlook it had lowered in May.“The positives for Target are the margin outperformance and inventory reduction, coupled with the fact that this is one of the most hated companies in all of retail (which means the bar is very low),” Vital Knowledge analyst Adam Crisafulli wrote in a note to clients.The shares jumped as much as 8.2% in New York trading Wednesday, the most intraday since March 2022. Target sank 16% this year through Tuesday. For comparison, an S&P index of US consumer-staples companies fell less than 1% over the same period, while the S&P 500 Index rose 16%. Shares of Walmart Inc. — a key competitor that will report quarterly results on Thursday — gained 12%.Story continuesFewer than half of analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying Target shares, compared with 81% of analysts who recommend buying Walmart’s stock.Target’s report was “clearly better than the extremely negative sentiment toward the story lately,” Rupesh Parikh, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Co., said in a note to clients. “We expect a relief rally today followed by a likely volatile trade for the balance of the year.”Pride ControversyRevenue during the latest quarter took an extra hit from a controversy that began in late May around Target’s Pride Month collection of LGBTQ-themed goods, which sparked protests from conservative activists and threatening behavior by some customers.While comparable sales slipped 3% in May, the metric tumbled 7% in June, Target said on a conference call to discuss the results. The drop eased to 5% in July, and Chief Executive Officer Brian Cornell said he was “very pleased” with sales trends in early August.The recent recovery is consistent with the resilience in US retail sales, which rose in July by more than economists had projected.New headwinds such as the resumption of student-loan repayments are likely to materialize in the coming months, Chief Financial Officer Michael Fiddelke said in a briefing with reporters. But the company is showcasing its food and beauty offerings, which are still selling briskly.“It’s prudent to be cautious right now,” he said. “Student-loan payments will cause additional pressure on already strained consumer budgets.”Adjusted earnings for the current fiscal year will be between $7 and $8 a share, Target said. The midpoint of $7.50 is 75 cents less than the average of the previous forecast range and is below the average analyst estimate of $7.81.In the fiscal second quarter, adjusted earnings jumped $1.80 a share, compared with the $1.40 average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Target’s gross margin, a broad measure of profitability, rose to 27%, while analyst had estimated 25.6%. Easing freight costs and stepped-up expense management provided a boost, the Minneapolis-based retailer said.Comparable sales dropped 5.4% during the quarter, worse than the 3.8% fall projected by analysts. The rise in demand for beauty products and food and beverages wasn’t enough to offset the weakness in many discretionary categories.(Updates with details from conference call in 10th paragraph.)©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: (Adds data on Pemex's debt)MEXICO CITY, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The Mexican government is likely to continue supporting heavily indebted state oil firm Pemex with about $15 billion per year, Fitch ratings agency said in an a report on Wednesday, adding these will at least cover international bond debt amortizations.However, should the government substantively increase its support for Pemex, this would have a negative credit effect on the sovereign, Fitch added.Pemex, whose financial debt surged to $110.5 billion by the second quarter of the year - the most of any state energy firm worldwide - receivedmore than $3 billionfrom the government last month to help it meet its obligations.Mexico President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed to revive Pemex, which he inherited with a towering debt, but concerns have been growing since he took office in late 2018.Under Lopez Obrador's presidency, Pemex bonds were stripped of a coveted investment grade rating, and two out of the three major ratings agencies rank the bonds speculative grade, or junk.

Text Content: MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) — Lawyers for a prominent Memphis couple planned to speak with reporters Wednesday about former NFL player Michael Oher’s effort to take control of his finances in a now-public dispute involving those who inspired the Oscar-nominated movie “The Blind Side.”Attorneys for Sean and Leigh Anne Tuohy scheduled a news conference to discuss Oher's accusations that they enriched themselves at his expense. Oher moved in with the Tuohys before his senior year of high school, a story that led to a movie that received an Academy Award nomination for best picture in 2010.The Tuohys have called the allegations ridiculous and part of a shakedown attempt.Oher filed a petition Monday in a Tennessee probate court accusing the Tuohys of lying to him by having him sign papers making them his conservators rather than his adoptive parents nearly two decades ago.Oher, now 37, wants a full accounting of assets considering his life story produced millions of dollars, though he says he received nothing from the movie. He accuses the Tuohys of falsely representing themselves as his adoptive parents.In a statement released by their lawyers Tuesday, the Tuohys said Oher’s accusations were absurd. They said Oher had threatened before the court filing to plant a negative news story about them unless they paid him $15 million, calling it a “shakedown.”The conservatorship paperwork was filed months after Oher turned 18 in May 2004. Oher accuses the Tuohys of never taking legal action to assume custody from the Tennessee Department of Human Services before he turned 18, though he was told to call them “Mom” and “Dad.”Oher alleges the Tuohys had him sign paperwork almost immediately after he moved in as part of the adoption process. Oher says he was “falsely advised” that it would be called a conservatorship because he was already 18, but that adoption was the intent. Oher said that he discovered in February 2023 that the conservatorship was not the arrangement he thought it was — and that it provided him no familial relationship to the Tuohys.Story continuesOher later attended Sean Tuohy’s alma mater, Mississippi.Oher, who has never been a fan of the movie about his life, asks that the Tuohys be sanctioned and required by the probate court to pay damages. He asks to be paid what he is due, along with interest.The Tuohys' statement says the idea that they sought to profit off Oher is ridiculous. The statement said that they are worth “hundreds of millions of dollars” and would not have sought to withhold money from Oher.“They have consistently treated him like a son and one of their three children,” the statement said.The Tuohys' statement says agents negotiated a small advance for them from the production company for “The Blind Side,” based on a book written by Sean Tuohy’s friend Michael Lewis. That included “a tiny percentage of net profits” divided equally among a group that included Oher.Martin Singer, an attorney for the Tuohys, said that profit participation checks and studio accounting statements support their account. The movie won Sandra Bullock an Oscar for her portrayal of Leigh Anne Tuohy.When Oher refused to cash the checks, the statement says the Tuohys deposited Oher’s share into a trust account.The Tuohys said that they set up the conservatorship to help Oher with health insurance, a driver’s license and being admitted to college. The statement says the Tuohys will not oppose Oher’s wish to end their conservatorship.Oher was the 23rd overall pick in the 2009 draft out of Mississippi, and he spent his first five seasons with the Baltimore Ravens where he won a Super Bowl. He played 110 games over eight NFL seasons, including 2014 when he started 11 games for the Tennessee Titans. Oher finished his career with two years in Carolina.He last played in 2016 and was released in 2017 by Carolina.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl

Text Content: GENEVA (Reuters) -A World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute settlement panel on Wednesday found that China had acted inconsistently with its WTO obligations by imposing additional duties on certain U.S. imports in response to U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminium.The office of the U.S. Trade Representative said it was pleased with the WTO decision, adding that China had "illegally retaliated with sham 'safeguard' tariffs."China's Commerce Ministry said it had noted the WTO panel decision and demanded that the United States immediately lift tariffs imposed on steel and aluminium imports.The U.S. imposed a 25% duty on steel imports and a 10% duty on aluminium imports in March 2018 based on the Donald Trump administration's "Section 232" national security investigation into steel and aluminium imports.The panel recommended that China bring its "WTO-inconsistent measures into conformity".Beijing could appeal the ruling, which would send it into a legal void because Washington has blocked appointments to the WTO Appellate Body, rendering it incapable of giving a judgment.The WTO ruled last year that the U.S. move had also violated international trade rules, with Washington also appealing the decision.In response to the U.S. duties, China announced that additional duties of between 15% and 25% would apply to certain imports originating in the United States, a measure challenged by Washington.The United States agreed to remove tariffs on EU imports in 2021 but President Joe Biden's administration has otherwise kept in place the metals tariffs that were one of the centrepieces of Trump's America First strategy.(Reporting by Gabrielle Tétrault-Farber in Geneva, Susan Heavey in Washington and Ella Cao in Beijing, Editing by Rachel More, Devika Syamnath and Sharon Singleton)

Text Content: (Rewrites throughout, adds Citi, Trafigura and Glencore)By Pratima Desai and Julian LukLONDON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Citibank has bought large amounts of zinc on the London Metal Exchange (LME) and arranged a lucrative deal to store the metal in LME approved warehouses, two sources with knowledge of the matter said.While the exact quantity bought by Citi is difficult to determine, zinc stocks in LME warehouses in Singapore have jumped 54% to 141,750 metric tons over the past two days, the highest since March 2022.Much of the zinc going on LME warrant - a title document that confers ownership - was sold into the system by Swiss-based commodity trader Trafigura and London-listed mining giant Glencore, the sources said.Citi, Glencore and Trafigura declined to comment.Demand for zinc, used to galvanise steel, has stalled alongside manufacturing activity around the world and industry sources say the surplus is being delivered to the LME, a market of last resort for some industrial metals.Citi has bought the zinc for so-called "rent deals" with warehouse companies in which the fees or rent for storing metal in LME facilities are shared, the sources said.Rent for metal on LME warrant is often five times higher than metal in storage that is not deliverable to LME warehouses. Rents for storing zinc in LME warehouses can average 54 U.S. cents a ton.Industry sources say smelters continuing to produce zinc even as demand weakened have fuelled the surplus."Steel sectors are slowing down so there's not much call for galvanising right now; that's fallen off a cliff," said Robert Montefusco at broker Sucden Financial.Analysts polled by Reuters last month expected a global zinc market surplus of 135,500 tons this year.A significant inflow of zinc into Singapore started three months ago, leading to off-LME inventory buildup. The Southeast Asian country brought in a total 117,464 tons of SHG zinc in May and June 2023, up from 32,634 tons in the same period last year."We saw a similar inflow in July, and more delivery is expected," a Singapore-based trader said, adding the origins of zinc ingots are from Spain, South Korea and India.The benchmark zinc price fell to $2,265.50 a metric ton on Wednesday, the lowest in more than two months and a drop of 35% since late January.

Text Content: Coinbase Global (COIN) said it received regulatory approval to offer US retail customers regulated crypto futures in the coming months, sending its stock up as much as 5% before the market open on Wednesday.The country’s largest crypto exchange said it secured the permission from National Futures Association (NFA), a self-regulatory organization designated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).The approval comes as Coinbase squares off against the Securities and Exchange Commission in court in the Southern District of New York. The federal securities regulator has alleged that Coinbase is operating as an unregistered securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency.The case will likely boil down to whether certain crypto assets should be considered securities or commodities in the US. Earlier this month, Coinbase asked a US judge to dismiss the lawsuit, arguing that the cryptocurrencies sold through its exchange are more like baseball cards than investment securities.Its stock is up 123% year to date, despite the SEC lawsuit, but it has fallen since reporting earnings earlier this month.Coinbase filed for approval to offer regulated crypto products shortly after its IPO two years ago. In 2022, it acquired CFTC-regulated futures exchange FairX, now rebranded to Coinbase Derivatives Exchange.The company has since launched trading in bitcoin and ether futures for institutional investors. Earlier this year, it also announced plans to spin out a derivatives platform for non-US citizens.The new approval from the NFA to offer crypto futures to US investors "is a significant milestone for bringing federal regulatory oversight over the crypto markets," Coinbase’s chief policy officer Faryar Shirzad said in a statement.Greg Tusar, vice president of institutional product at Coinbase, said in a blog post that Coinbase is the first crypto-only platform to offer regulated crypto futures products and spot crypto trading to US investors.Story continues“Access to a CFTC-regulated crypto derivatives market is essential to unlocking significant growth and enabling broader participation in the cryptoeconomy,” Tusar added.Coinbase employees gather in New York's Times Square in 2021 as the exchange becomes a public company. (Richard Drew/AP Photo)In the coming months, Coinbase will provide US customers with more information on how they can access the platform’s futures products.Derivatives products allow investors to use leverage to make investments with less upfront investment than trading spot crypto. Investors can also use futures products to take long or short positions on a cryptocurrency's future performance. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) already offers bitcoin and ether futures.Derivatives products also provide an essential way for crypto trading venues to not only attract customers and earn higher revenues but also control a higher share of the industry’s total trading volume.The global crypto derivatives market represents approximately 75% of crypto trading volume worldwide.In past years, so-called offshore exchanges such as Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, and the now-bankrupt FTX managed to take market share from Coinbase by offering traditional futures as well as more popular perpetual futures and options trading.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance

West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) is hovering above $80 per barrel.Concerns over China’s economy, the world’s second largest consumer of crude, recently has put pressure on crude futures. Data released Tuesday by China's National Bureau of Statistics added to concerns of a sluggish recovery as Beijing unexpectedly cut policy rates and withheld information on youth unemployment."Some investors remain skeptical that China’s latest stimulus efforts—a 15- basis-point cut to its one-year medium-term lending facility (MLF) and a 10bps cut to the short-term 7-day reverse repo rate—will be sufficient to revive demand," the UBS note said. "China is the world’s largest oil importer, the second-largest consumer, and the seventh-largest producer."However, UBS strategists don’t expect the price slide to persist amid firming fundamentals. Those include declining inventories and tight supply as OPEC+ production nears a two year low.OPEC+ has been cutting production since October of last year.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- GQG Partners bought 8.1% of the total outstanding shares in billionaire Gautam Adani-controlled Adani Power Ltd. for about $1.1 billion through block deals on Wednesday, according to people familiar with the matter.The US investor bought more than 310.9 million shares of Adani’s thermal power generation arm as the embattled power-to-port conglomerate seeks international backing in a bid to recover from a scathing shortselling attack earlier this year.This is one of the largest bulk deals by the Adani family for raising funds, two of the people said, asking not to be identified as the information is private.The shares were purchased from Adani family entities — Worldwide Emerging Market Holding Ltd. and Afro Asia Trade and Investments Ltd., according to stock exchange data.This deal comes days after the auditor of Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd. resigned fueling concerns about accounting quality at the Indian conglomerate targeted by shortseller Hindenburg Research.The latest deal would serve as a vote of confidence for tycoon Adani, who has been attempting a comeback from the crisis triggered by Hindenburg’s report in January that leveled fraud allegations against Adani Group.The block deal also comes after the Qatar Investment Authority bought a roughly 2.7% stake in the listed green energy business earlier this month. Adani Group has started making a comeback in fundraising in recent months following an improvement in its debt metrics. The latest efforts to get investors indicate the conglomerate is further restoring investor confidence after the shortseller accused it of widespread corporate malfeasance.Story continuesThe report by the US shortseller alleged that Adani Group engaged in years-long corporate fraud and stock price manipulation, charges that the company has repeatedly denied. It nevertheless fueled a major stock and bond sell off from which the conglomerate has only partly recovered from.“Sale of more shares in Adani companies could help meet the group’s large funding needs and fund growth, assuming governance concerns persist and lead to weakened funding access,” Sharon Chen, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst, wrote in a research note earlier on Wednesday. Adani’s family “could raise more than $15 billion while maintaining control of its key listed entities, based on share prices as of Aug. 14,” she said.--With assistance from Debjit Chakraborty, Devidutta Tripathy, Ashutosh Joshi and Chiranjivi Chakraborty.(Updates throughout with details of buyer)©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Deadly rupture. Groundwater contamination. Earthquake triggers. One after another, residents from across Iowa fired off their concerns at a meeting with federal and state representatives to discuss a technology that could help protect the climate — and reshape their backyards.How to handle captured carbon dioxide dominated the agenda at a two-day meeting hosted by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) in Des Moines this spring. Communities that could one day host pipelines filled with CO2 were able to weigh in before regulators as the US begins to deploy carbon capture and storage technology in earnest. The climate solution, championed by President Joe Biden, didn’t get a warm welcome.“We don't deserve to have these dangerous pipelines that could kill us next to our homes so that these private companies can get even wealthier than they already are,” Des Moines resident Jess Mazour said to applause at the meeting, during which many attendees wore buttons opposing CO2 pipelines.Carbon capture is a catch-all term for technologies that trap and store carbon dioxide. In some cases, carbon is sucked from the atmosphere by the emerging process of direct air capture. More common are systems that capture carbon as it’s released from fossil fuel-burning power plants, heavy industries like steel- or cement-making, and at the sites that process fuels like natural gas. Some of that CO2 can be reused, but more typically it’s compressed, transported and then injected back into the ground in saline aquifers or spent oil and gas reservoirs.Globally, only a few dozen carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects have been built, mainly due to the uncertain economics and technological complexity. But as those challenges dissipate, early fights in the US — home to the world’s biggest network of CO2 pipelines — could be a harbinger of opposition ahead.Story continuesThe particular pipelines that had Mazour and other Iowans up in arms were designed to transport carbon captured from ethanol plants in Iowa to neighboring states, where it will be pumped about a mile below ground. Those logistics are emblematic: While carbon will ultimately be captured all over the US, the storage bins for it — deep geologic formations capable of locking away CO2 — are largely concentrated in a few places.At scale, that will mean miles and miles of CO2 pipelines crisscrossing the country, an infrastructure windfall that’s already attracting intensified corporate interest. Last month, Exxon Mobil Corp. agreed to spend nearly $5 billion buying Denbury Inc. so it can take control of the company’s 1,300-mile network of carbon pipelines, part of the oil giant’s preparations for boom times in CCS. Earlier this week, Warren Buffett-backed Occidental Petroleum Corp. agreed to buy Canadian startup Carbon Engineering Ltd. for $1.1 billionFor companies that operate CCS infrastructure, there’s serious money at stake. The Inflation Reduction Act that Biden signed last year raised the tax credit for CCS to $85 per ton — an increase of 70% — in an effort to make costly projects more financially rewarding. That uncapped incentive could pay out billions of dollars to CCS outfits in years to come. The US Department of Energy (DOE) also pledged $251 million in funding to 12 projects that promise to bolster CO2 transportation and storage infrastructure.“We don't deserve to have these dangerous pipelines that could kill us next to our homes so that these private companies can get even wealthier than they already are.”The scale of government support is indicative of the scale of potential need in the US: as much as 1.7 billion tonnes of captured carbon each year by 2050 in order to meet its net-zero goal, based on a recent analysis led by Princeton University researchers. That would be an 80-fold increase over today’s estimated US capacity of about 21 million tonnes, according to the Melbourne-based think tank Global CCS Institute.“We're already behind on meeting those climate goals,” says John Thompson, director of Clean Air Task Force, an environmental group based in Boston. “Any delays in moving ahead with carbon capture and storage fundamentally harm all of us.”As new CCS projects appear on the horizon, more backlash is brewing. In Texas, an alliance of community members and environmental organizations filed a petition in May challenging the approval of a new liquified natural gas project that would be paired with carbon capture, which opponents derided as “greenwashing.” In Louisiana, the council of Livingston Parish last year issued a temporary moratorium for a hydrogen producer’s proposal to sequester CO2 near Lake Maurepas, citing ecological and health risks. (The moratorium was later overruled by a federal judge.)Despite rising pushback, “I don’t think it will get to the point where there is a broad moratorium on the technology,” says Noah Deich, who helps oversee CCS development at the DOE. Local resistance could, however, make deployment more costly if CO2 pipeline detours become necessary, Deich says. To ease the tension, the DOE includes community benefit plans as part of its review criteria for sponsoring CCS projects.The opposition to CCS pipelines in some ways mirrors local fights over clean energy projects, which have slowed down deployment in recent years. An analysis published in May by the Columbia Sabin Center for Climate Change Law found nearly 300 renewable energy projects in 45 states that have encountered what the researchers dubbed “significant opposition.” Resistance to fossil fuel infrastructure, including pipelines, has also been well-documented and widespread across the country. To that end, the CCS pushback also extends to the injection wells where captured carbon dioxide typically ends up.The protests and permitting fights are already spooking some investors. Alex Tiller, chief executive officer of Carbonvert, which is bankrolling and developing CCS projects in the US, says there’s a chicken-and-egg problem at work. The owner of a steel plant or ethanol mill may be reluctant to commit to installing carbon-capture technology until they know they have pipelines to carry away that captured gas and wells to store it. But investors may be loath to support those carbon pipelines and injection wells until they know they'll have a stream of CO2 to handle in the first place.“Those circular references here cause a lot of angst and concern,” Tiller says. “And people that have a light understanding of the opportunity and the need and the safety around this can easily inject sand into the gears and cause a problem.”Summit Carbon Solutions, based out of Ames, Iowa, plans to build a $5 billion CO2 pipeline that will stretch 2,000 miles across five states, including South Dakota, whose impacted landowners took the developer to court. They accused Summit of abusing eminent domain, a legal right typically granted to businesses such as railway developers and power grid operators to access private property for public use. The plaintiffs argue that transporting and storing CO2 shouldn’t qualify as a project for the greater good.“This is the most united [moment] that our local community has had on issues since probably World War II,” says Mark Lapka, 42, a farmer in McPherson County, South Dakota, and one of the plaintiffs. “Everybody's pretty much in agreement that this isn't something that we particularly want in our community.”Summit says it has so far secured voluntary easement agreements covering nearly 75% of its proposed CO2 pipeline route and described community support for the project as “overwhelming.” The company aims to begin construction by the end of this year or early next. But getting the remaining landowners on board could take years of litigation, according to Jennifer Zwagerman, an associate professor of law at Drake University who has studied CCS resistance in the Midwest.There are regulatory headwinds, too. Earlier this month, the North Dakota Public Service Commission rejected a permit application from Summit for the part of its pipeline project that would run across the state. The government agency said the developer had failed to address concerns raised by local authorities and residents. Summit said it will file a petition for the state’s reconsideration in North Dakota. In Iowa, South Dakota, Minnesota and Nebraska, the company is still in the application process.There’s a sharp divide on CCS deployment among environmental groups. A number of organizations, including the Center for Biological Diversity and Greenpeace USA, have joined the anti-CCS camp, voicing concerns that range from the use of the technology by the oil industry to the infrastructure’s environmental impact on communities. Opponents of CO2 pipelines in the Midwest have echoed those anxieties.When Susan and Jerry Stoefen found out last year that their land sits in the path of a carbon dioxide pipeline planned by Wolf Carbon Solutions, the couple rebuffed company representatives who came by to survey their land three different times. Denver, Colorado-based Wolf is looking to capture CO2 from ethanol plants in Iowa and inject it underground in Illinois. Now the Stoefens, both in their 60s, are actively working to stop that project.The couple made multiple five-hour round trips to Des Moines this year in a (failed) attempt to convince Iowa politicians to block the CCS plan. They also attended at least five community meetings to voice concerns. On a sunny afternoon in May, after picking kale, spinach and radishes from the garden, the Stoefens sat in their farmhouse surrounded by anti-CO2 pipeline signs to explain why.“People say we have to do something to reduce carbon and we’re all for that,” Susan says. But both of them feel that capturing carbon emissions from ethanol production is like trying to treat a malignant tumor instead of removing it. Rather than setting out to make lower-carbon ethanol, they say the US could invest in wider adoption of carbon-free technologies.The Stoefens are also skeptical about CCS in practice. “I don't believe that the science is correct by pumping CO2 into the ground,” says Jerry, a retired plumber who has spent months reading CCS news and attending workshops hosted by environmental NGOs such as the Sierra Club. He says storing captured carbon in geologic formations reminds him of fracking, which has been widely used to extract more oil and gas and has also been linked to earthquakes and groundwater pollution.“Will this process cause earthquakes?” Jerry asks. “Will CO2 leach into underground water resources? Will CO2 eventually leach back to the surface and end up in the atmosphere?”In an email response to Bloomberg Green, Nick Noppinger, senior vice president of corporate development at Wolf Carbon Solutions, said the company has made landowner and community outreach “a top priority” and is “actively listening” to their feedback.Researchers are currently looking into questions very much like Jerry’s. Underground injection of CO2, theoretically, “could induce seismicity,” Molly McEvoy, an engineer from the US Environmental Protection Agency, said during the PHMSA meeting in Des Moines. She stressed that progress has been made to mitigate this risk: “We would want to prevent that from happening.”Safety concerns are common among those worried about CO2 pipelines in their communities. While carbon dioxide is minimally toxic when inhaled, breathing oxygen-depleted air caused by high CO2 concentrations can lead to suffocation. In 2020, when a CO2 pipeline burst in Satartia, Mississippi, at least 45 people were hospitalized and 200 more were evacuated. Cars with combustion engines also failed to start in the oxygen-depleted environment, delaying an emergency response.“It only takes two minutes at the most to die from asphyxiation,” says Jennifer Winn, 39, a resident of Hawarden, Iowa, who opposes a CO2 pipeline that Navigator CO2 Ventures is planning nearby. If the Omaha, Nebraska-based company succeeds, the pipe would be plugged into an ethanol plant five miles from Winn’s home. “That is a terrifying thought for me,” she says. “Our rural emergency response crews don't have the means to save people.”Navigator said it has modeled the potential impact in the event of a pipeline rupture multiple times and has shared a detailed technical overview with emergency response crews across its project footprint. Since January, several hundred first-responders across that same footprint have received training specific to CO2 leakage incidents, the company said, adding that it plans to engage more and provide needed equipment.Winn is unconvinced. After living in Iowa for nearly 20 years, she’s even considering moving: “That’s how concerning this is to me.”“We don't deserve to have these dangerous pipelines that could kill us next to our homes so that these private companies can get even wealthier than they already are.”While there have been CO2 pipeline accidents, it’s not clear if the larger safety concerns are rooted in data. For every 1,000 miles of CO2 pipelines built in the US, on average only 1.15 leaks or other disruptions occurred over the past five years, according to the PHMSA. Crude oil pipelines have an incident rate more than double that level. But the CCS industry also has a much smaller footprint, which could distort its safety record, and little experience building at scale. Federal regulators say they have updated safety rules and are drafting new regulations to further strengthen government oversight of CO2 pipelines. But that process will take time.“We’re concerned about the fact that this country has never done this before,” says Brian Jorde, an attorney at Domina Law Group who represents nearly 1,000 Midwest landowners in lawsuits against Summit, Wolf and Navigator.Even if CCS companies succeed in their permit applications, communities get on board with planned pipelines and safety concerns are allayed, there’s still an open debate around what carbon capture should be for. When the technology was first developed in the 1970s, it was deployed by oil companies to extract more fuel out of the ground. In 1996, Norwegian oil giant Equinor ASA sunk CO2 in saline reserves to avoid paying carbon taxes. Since then, carbon capture has been blamed for perpetuating oil and gas operations that might otherwise be phased out faster.“Carbon capture is basically a way to keep oil, gas and coal going,” says David Schlissel, a researcher with the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. “The longer we rely on fossil fuels, the longer we're going to have climate problems.”Expert opinion here is split. The UN-backed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, whose landmark scientific reports provide the gold standard of climate research, in 2021 embraced carbon capture as a way to reduce emissions. The International Energy Agency bakes capturing 7.6 billion tonnes of CO2 by midcentury into its roadmap for reaching net zero. That research seems to indicate the technology is coming whether communities like it or not.A growing number of CCS projects globally suggests the same. The European Union aims to be able to inject as much as 50 million tonnes of CO2 underground annually by 2030. Japan has rolled out plans to develop seven CCS hubs on- and offshore. Emerging economies from Brazil to Thailand are getting in on the act, too.But skeptical researchers like Schlissel point to a lingering paradox: Pumping carbon dioxide underground may be a “quick” climate solution, but regulatory approval and designing and constructing complex CCS infrastructure all takes time. “I doubt many, if any, [CCS projects] would be built by 2030,” Schlissel says. By that point, the US aims to have reduced greenhouse gas emissions roughly 50% compared with 2005 levels.Like many other CCS opponents, Vicki Hulse of Moville, Iowa, has doubts about the technology’s overall climate benefits. She’s part of the pushback against the Navigator project, and argues that a large amount of energy needed to construct and operate that infrastructure could potentially cancel out the CO2 emissions that it promises to remove.Navigator says the carbon footprint associated with its project will be roughly 1 million metric tons, which is “negligible” compared to the 10 million metric tons of CO2 it could capture and sequester each year. Without specifying the number of easement sign-ups, the company also said in a statement that “a majority of the impacted landowners are actually supportive” of its CCS project.Hulse isn’t one of them. The 67-year-old retiree has fought a series of legal battles against Navigator, and has no intention of backing down anytime soon. “There is absolutely no amount of money that you can pay me to put this underneath my ground,” she says. “I will fight for it until my last breath.”--With assistance from Jennifer A Dlouhy.(Updated to reflect Occidental’s acquisition of Carbon Engineering in seventh paragraph.

Text Content: (Updates death toll in first paragraph, fire containment in 3rd paragraph)By Jonathan OatisAug 16 (Reuters) -Wildfires on Hawaii's Maui have killed at least 106 people, forced tens of thousands of residents and tourists to evacuate the island and devastated the historic resort city of Lahaina. It's the deadliest U.S. wildfire in more than a century. The Big Island of Hawaii is also battling wildfires, which have caused no fatalities.Here are some key questions and answers about the blazes:ARE THE MAUI FIRES STILL BURNING?Firefighting crews were still battling flare-ups. The largest fire in Lahaina was 85% contained as of early Wednesday and had burned 2,170 acres (880 hectares), Maui County said, adding that there were no active threats . Another fire in upcountry/Kula was 75% contained and had charred 678 acres. Smaller fires elsewhere were 100% contained or extinguished.The fires, which started the night of Aug. 8, wreaked widespread destruction in Lahaina. The city of about 13,000 people on northwestern Maui was once a whaling center and the Hawaiian Kingdom's capital, and now draws 2 million tourists a year.Cadaver dogs searched Lahaina's charred ruins for victims, and officials said it was likely the number of dead would rise.The fire destroyed or damaged more than 2,200 buildings, 86% of them residential, officials said. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) estimates it will cost $5.5 billion to rebuild the town.HOW DOES THE DEATH TOLL COMPARE WITH THAT OF OTHER FIRES? The Maui blaze is the deadliest U.S. wildfire since 1918, when northern Minnesota's Cloquet Fire, which raged for more than four days, claimed 453 lives, according to the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA). The deadliest wildfire in U.S history, Wisconsin's Peshtigo fire in 1871, killed 1,152.Hawaii's fires also constitute the most lethal disaster to hit the islands since a tsunami that killed 61 people in 1960, a year after Hawaii became a U.S. state.Story continuesWHAT ABOUT HAWAII'S DISASTER WARNING SIRENS?Some Maui residents have questioned whether more could have been done to alert them. Witnesses said they had little warning, describing their terror as the blaze destroyed Lahaina in what seemed like minutes. Some people dove into the Pacific Ocean to escape.Sirens stationed around the island - intended to warn of impending natural disasters - never sounded, and widespread power and cellular outages hampered other forms of alerting.Hawaii Governor Josh Green vowed on Sunday to investigate the response and emergency notification systems.HOW DID THE FIRES START?The causes of the fires have not yet been determined. The National Weather Service had issued warnings for the Hawaiian Islands for high winds and dry weather - conditions ripe for wildfires.Nearly 85% of U.S. wildfires are caused by humans, according to the U.S. Forest Service. Natural causes include lightning and volcanic activity. In Hawaii, less than 1% of fires are due to natural causes, according to Elizabeth Pickett, co-executive director of the Hawaii Wildfire Management Organization. The Hawaiian Islands have six active volcanoes, including one on Maui. The spread of flammable non-native grasses in areas of former farmland and forest has created large amounts of small, easily ignited materials that increase the risk and severity of fire.Record-setting heat this summer has contributed to unusually severe wildfires in Europe and western Canada. Scientists say climate change, driven by fossil fuel use, has led to more frequent and more powerful extreme weather events.WHY DID SHARES OF HAWAIIAN ELECTRIC FALL?Hawaiian Electric Industries shares have lost half their value this week amid growing scrutiny over whether the utility's equipment played any role in the wildfires.On Monday, the stock plummeted just moments after the opening bell due to residents filing lawsuits claiming it was responsible for the fires. Shares continued dropping on Tuesday, and the S&P downgraded Hawaiian Electric's credit rating to junk status. The ratings agency cited damage caused to the company's customer base and the lawsuits.Hawaiian Electric did not respond to requests for comment. On Friday, before the lawsuits were filed, the company said it was working with Maui County to investigate what happened.(Compiled by Jonathan Oatis; editing by Lisa Shumaker)

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- From almost the moment Argentina restructured $65 billion of debt three years ago, investors have been betting the next default was around the corner. This week, they got a better idea of who their negotiating partner will be when it comes, and they’re not at all encouraged.As traders take stock ahead of what they expect will end up becoming the country’s fourth debt workout in two decades, overseas bonds have slumped to a two-month low. The tumble follows a shock primary result Sunday that showed voters favoring a mop-topped libertarian economist with radical proposals to dollarize the economy and lead Argentina out of its perennial economic crisis.Javier Milei, the outsider congressman who won a third of the primary vote ahead of October’s presidential election, is a firebrand often compared with Donald Trump or Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro. While he’s said very little about Argentina’s debt problem or the country’s relationship with creditors, investors are fretting about the implications of negotiating with a little-known populist when the all-but-inevitable restructuring comes.“He’s an outsider and voters are frustrated,” said Jared Lou, a portfolio manager at William Blair. “If he does eventually become president, it’s not clear which policy proposals he will be able to implement, given he’s likely to face significant opposition in congress.”The Sunday vote sparked a selloff in the nation’s overseas bonds, sending some securities dipping back below 30 cents on the dollar. The government devalued the peso the same day, a step analysts had been urging for a long time but still came with unexpected timing.Story continuesArgentina’s sovereign bonds due 2030 extended losses on Wednesday, dropping 0.3 cent to 31.3 cents on the dollar.Meanwhile, Wall Street is reexamining its assumptions about what the next restructuring will look like as shops from Credit Suisse to Wells Fargo predict Milei as the favorite to take over the presidency in December.“Based on the country’s long history of defaults and debt restructurings, we do not find Argentine sovereign bonds suitable for a hold-to-maturity investment strategy, but only for trade-oriented investors with a high risk-appetite,” said Alejo Czerwonko, the chief investment officer for emerging markets in the Americas at UBS AG in New York. “We also caution against sizable allocations in investment portfolios.”As Czerwonko’s note signaled, the debt woes shouldn’t come as any surprise for longtime investors in Argentina, who have been bracing for the country’s 10th default from the moment it exited its ninth. After money managers got around 55 cents on the dollar in the last restructuring, the securities sank almost immediately to less than 40 cents, a sign investors fully expected the serial defaulter to fall back into old habits.Investors are so sure Argentina is headed for another default because it’s been unable to build up its international reserves ahead of a wall of payments on the bonds starting next year. Central bank reserves have dipped to a 17-year low as the economy heads toward its sixth recession in a decade.Now, Wall Street is trying to determine just how much it can expect in the next restructuring. Czerwonko’s base case is that investors get an average 40 cents on the dollar for their bonds at an exit yield of around 15%, without a major haircut on the principal of the securities.Argentina — which has paid near zero interest since 2020 — has $2.6 billion in payments due next year and $5.6 billion in 2025, according to Morgan Stanley analyst Simon Waever. He thinks bonds could be worth around 43 cents on the dollar if the next administration pushes out payments another four years on average.In the best — albeit unlikely — case that Argentina avoids a default altogether, he sees the notes surging to around 50% of face value.The primaries “did not bring the clarity the market was hoping for, even if a path to the bull case remains,” Waever wrote. He recommends Argentina’s cheaper bonds maturing in 2046.Race to the RightBenchmark bonds due in 2030 had climbed as high as 36 cents on the dollar in the run-up to the vote, from as low as 24 cents in mid-April. The rally was fed by speculation the nation’s politics would swing right in the next election as voters moved to oust President Alberto Fernandez’s administration, which has overseen the worsening crisis.But the mainstream center-right coalition got just 28% of ballots, compared with the ruling party’s 27% support, leaving Milei the clear front-runner ahead of the presidential vote. His closest competitor may be Patricia Bullrich — a hardline former security minister from the market-friendly opposition coalition.Even incumbent Economy Minister Sergio Massa, whose coalition lagged on Sunday night, is seen tacking right if his party were to remain in power.“The election trade predicated on the ‘change’ of the political landscape remains in play,” according to Citigroup strategists Dirk Willer and Donato Guarino, who recommend selling Argentina’s 2030 bonds and buying cheaper notes maturing in 2035.To be sure, the results are far from certain, with each of the country’s three main political camps with similar levels of support. Participation in the primaries was only around 70%, and it’s unclear if voters whose candidates were knocked out Sunday will remain with their coalition, or migrate to another candidate in October’s first round vote.It’s also likely the presidential vote will go to a runoff in November, which happens if the top candidate doesn’t receive 45% of valid votes in the first round, or fails to clinch 40% while holding onto a 10 percentage-point lead over the runner-up.All the twists and turns ahead mean that Argentina’s bonds are likely to slump over the next few months, according to Diego Ferro, founder of M2M Capital in New York.“I doubt we’ve seen the lows before the election,” he said. “Once a candidate gets elected, any of them will try to be more market friendly, but that doesn’t mean the challenges won’t still exist.”--With assistance from Giovanna Bellotti Azevedo, Zijia Song, Maria Elena Vizcaino and Philip Sanders.(Updates with bond prices in sixth paragraph)©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: NEW YORK (AP) — The Justice Department said Wednesday that two directors resigned from Nextdoor's board in response to the department's efforts to enforce an antitrust law aimed at barring executives from holding similar positions at rival companies.The Justice Department pointed to Section 8 of the federal Clayton Act — which, in most cases, prohibits company directors and officers from serving on the boards of competitors at the same time. An enforcement initiative from the department's antitrust division has led to the resignations of 15 interlocking directors on 11 boards so far, it said.“We remain steadfast in our commitment to protect competition by preventing interlocking directorates that we believe violate Section 8 of the Clayton Act,” Deputy Assistant Attorney General Andrew Forman of the department’s antitrust division said in a statement.The directors' resignations from Nextdoor's board went into effect Aug. 1, “without the directors or either company admitting liability,” the department said.When reached on Wednesday, San Francisco-based Nextdoor directed The Associated Press to a July regulatory filing that identified the resigning directors as Leslie Kilgore and Andrea Wishom. According to the filing, Kilgore and Wishom informed the neighborhood-focused social network company of their decision to step down on July 25.“Neither of Ms. Kilgore’s nor Ms. Wishom’s resignation was the result of any disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to the Company’s operations, policies or practices,” Nextdoor said.Pinterest did not immediately respond to the AP's requests for comment Wednesday, but both Kilgore and Wishom are listed as directors on company's website. The image-sharing social media platform is also headquartered in San Francisco.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Tencent Holdings Ltd. said it plans to unveil a proprietary artificial-intelligence model later this year that it believes will be among the best in China, an early sign the internet powerhouse expects to compete in the field against early leaders such as Baidu Inc. and SenseTime Group Inc.Tencent executives, addressing the AI phenomenon after reporting financial results, said its progress in developing a large language model to power generative AI and other applications was going very well. The games giant has been perceived as trailing some of its domestic peers, in part because it’s said little about its efforts. It has been testing the model, called Hunyuan, on services like cloud computing and search.“It’s among the top leading foundation models produced in China,” said Martin Lau, the company’s president, on the second-quarter earnings call Wednesday. “We are very relentlessly working on the upgrade and iteration to prepare it for launch at some point of time in the latter part of this year.”Tencent said its experimentation with AI goes far beyond the kind of bots made famous by OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The Chinese company is testing AI internally for gaming, cloud computing and financial technology. It also anticipates being able to use the technology to boost its advertising and marketing efforts.“AI, the more we look at it, the more excited we are about it as a growth multiplier for our business,” Lau said. “We look at the opportunity and technology much more broadly than just a chatbot and Q&A type of experience.”On the cloud side, Tencent is preparing a marketplace for business clients, where they can pick and choose generative AI-powered services, which will translate into high-margin profit to the company, Lau says.Story continuesFor more on Tencent second-quarter earnings, click here for our TOPLive blog.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: (Updates prices at 1145 GMT, adds China context and analyst comment)By Harry RobertsonLONDON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Global stocks slipped on Wednesday for the third time in four sessions as weak Chinese economic data and concerns about the country's financial sector weighed on investor sentiment.European stocks traded at around one-month lows after a sharp fall on Tuesday, while U.S. futures flatlined. Investors were waiting for minutes from the Federal Reserve's July meeting, due out later on Wednesday.The MSCI World stock index was down 0.25% as of 1145 GMT. Asian equities saw the biggest drops, with the MSCI Asia index, which excludes Japan, falling 1.04%."Much of the decline is explained by continuing concerns surrounding the economic slowdown in China, as well as rising tensions with the U.S.," said Thomas Gehlen, senior market strategist at Kleinwort Hambros.China's new home prices fell for the first time this year in July, data showed on Wednesday.The Chinese central bank lowered its policy rate on Tuesday, after a long run of weak figures, but investors have so far been unimpressed by the response.News that a leading Chinese trust firm has missed repayments on dozens of investment products since late last month added to fears the country's property crisis would have a wider impact."If things deteriorate further, if there's more sign of a contagion or financial stress in the banking sector, I think it's inevitable that the U.S. or other markets will see some impact," said Janet Mui, head of market analysis at RBC Brewin Dolphin.Europe's STOXX 600 stock index was little changed on Wednesday after Tuesday's 0.93% fall, which was driven by concerns about global inflation and China. It traded just above a one-month low hit earlier in the session.Futures on the U.S. S&P 500 index and Nasdaq were both flat.The S&P 500 fell 1.16% on Tuesday after stronger-than-expected U.S. retail sales data added to the pressure on the Fed to keep interest rates at high levels.Story continuesGermany's DAX was up 0.21% after losing 0.86% on Tuesday, while Britain's FTSE 100 fell 0.36% following a 1.57% drop.In currency markets, sterling picked up after data showed that Britain's inflation fell in July but the core measure came in slightly higher than expected. It was last up 0.29% at $1.274.The dollar index, which measures the currency against six major peers, was down 0.1% at 103.11, ending a run of four straight daily increases.Investors have bought the safe-haven dollar on the back of strong U.S. economic data and rising concerns about China. The euro was up 0.12% at $1.092.Markets will get a sense of the Fed's thinking on interest rates at 1800 GMT (2 p.m. ET), when the minutes from July's decision are released. The Fed raised rates by 25 basis points to a 5.25% to 5.5% range at the meeting.According to pricing in derivatives markets, traders think the Fed has probably finished raising rates."There's very little priced in for the September meeting and there's only 10 basis points priced in for the early November meeting, which I think is significantly underpricing the risks that there will be a rate hike at one of those two meetings," said Colin Asher, senior economist at Mizuho.The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note was down 3 basis points at 4.189% on Wednesday, after hitting a more than nine-month high of 4.274% in the previous session.U.S. crude oil and Brent crude were little changed, at $80.92 a barrel and $84.81 a barrel respectively.(Reporting by Harry Robertson in London, additional reporting by Kane Wu in Hong Kong; Editing by Lincoln Feast, Sam Holmes, Tomasz Janowski and Barbara Lewis)

Text Content: BERLIN, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Interpreters for German forces in Mali have asked Berlin for protection for themselves and their families as the troops prepare to pull out by the end of the year, the defence ministry in Berlin said on Wednesday.The Bundeswehr has deployed some 1,000 troops in Mali where their main task has been reconnaissance for the 13,000-strong UN peacekeeping mission MINUSMA which is about to withdraw after the junta in Bamako asked them to leave.The German military says it employs some 60 local staff in Mali in total."We are conscious of our duty of care for our local staff and take their subjective feeling of being under threat seriously," a spokesperson for the defence ministry said, confirming a Spiegel magazine report that the interpreters had sent a letter to the government.She added the government had a range of protective measures at its disposal that could be drawn upon in case of a crisis or should local staff be in danger because of their work for the Germans.A German diplomat told Reuters the foreign ministry was monitoring the security situation in Mali closely, and that each ministry was responsible for the protection of its own staff.Germany and other Western countries were criticised for leaving thousands of local staff behind in Afghanistan when the Taliban seized power in August 2021, prompting a hurried and chaotic evacuation.MINUSMA was established in 2013 to support foreign and local troops battling Islamist militants, but in recent months there have been repeated instances of tensions between the Malian authorities and the mission.Western powers fear that Niger, where the government was overthrown in a coup last month, could go the same way as neighbouring Mali, whose leaders hired mercenaries from Russia's Wagner group to help them fight an insurgency after they overthrew the democratic government three years ago and kicked out French troops.

Text Content: (Updates with release of minutes)By Howard Schneider and Michael S. DerbyWASHINGTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Federal Reserve officials were divided over the need for more interest rate hikes at the U.S. central bank's July 25-26 meeting, with "some participants" citing the risks to the economy of pushing rates too far even as "most" policymakers continued to prioritize the battle against inflation, according to minutes of the session that were released on Wednesday."Participants remained resolute in their commitment to bring inflation down to the ... 2% objective," the minutes said of a meeting in which policymakers on the Federal Open Market Committee unanimously agreed to raise the benchmark overnight interest rate to the 5.25%-5.50% range. "Most participants continued to see significant upside risks to inflation, which could require further tightening of monetary policy."Yet cautionary voices about the effects of continued monetary tightening appeared to play a more prominent role in the debate at last month's policy meeting, an indication that the spread of opinion at the Fed has widened as policymakers weigh evidence that inflation is falling and judge the potential damage to jobs and economic growth if rates are raised higher than necessary.A "couple" of participants, for example, advocated leaving rates unchanged in July.The group also "discussed several risk-management considerations that could bear on future policy decisions," the minutes said. Though a majority kept inflation as the paramount risk, "some participants commented that even though economic activity had been resilient and the labor market had remained strong, there continued to be downside risks to economic activity and upside risks to the unemployment rate.""These included the possibility that the macroeconomic effects of the tightening in financial conditions since the beginning of last year could prove more substantial than anticipated."Story continuesIn general, the minutes said, Fed policymakers agreed that the level of uncertainty remained high, and that future rate decisions would depend on the "totality" of data arriving in "coming months" to "help clarify the extent to which the disinflation process was continuing" - a possible indication of a more patient approach to any further rate increases.The July meeting was held before the release of data that showed key price measures falling this summer alongside ebbing job creation.Investors in contracts tied to the federal funds rate are betting heavily that the Fed won't raise its benchmark rate again during the current tightening cycle, and as of Wednesday morning had put a 90% chance on the prospect that the central bank would leave rates unchanged at its Sept. 19-20 meeting.

Text Content: BEIRUT (AP) — Syria’s president early Wednesday doubled public sector wages and pensions as the war-torn country’s national currency spiraled further downwards, reaching a new low for the year.President Bashar Assad issued the two decrees just before midnight Tuesday as the Syrian pound’s value against the U.S. dollar declined to a new all-time low, down from 7,000 at the beginning of 2023 to 15,000 pounds to the greenback. At the start of the conflict in 2011, the dollar was trading at 47 pounds.For over a year, Damascus has been restructuring its program of subsidies for gasoline, diesel for heating, and bread. At the launch of the restructure in February last year, Syrian Prime Minister Hussein Arnous said the move to scale back fuel subsidies would allow the program to target the poorest families more effectively as well as reducing the Syrian state’s deficit.Though wheat and bread subsidies have not been affected, the move has sparked rare protests in the country, as families struggle to cope with skyrocketing inflation. Syria hiked fuel prices Wednesday, soon after Assad’s decree, further rolling back state subsidies.“The national economy is in a clear state of instability, most notably rapid rise of the currency exchange rate,” Arnous told Syria’s parliament in a speech late last month, warning that financing government spending through debt and borrowing from the central bank is not sustainable.Syria’s last wage hike was in December 2021, where Assad raised civil service salaries by 30%.The increase in wages might be an immediate relief for Syrians, but would be temporary at best as its economic situation continues to worsen, Sam Heller, fellow at New York-based think tank Century International, told The Associated Press.“It seems likely to fuel inflation and thus worsen the continued depreciation of Syria’s currency,” he said.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition-linked war monitoring group based in Britain, said that hours after the decree was issued, fuel and produce prices increased, as public discontent over the dire economic situation worsens.Story continuesSyria's currency has been depreciating since 2019, further worsened by neighboring Lebanon's economic meltdown and Covid-19. However, the recent wage hike and a massive government payout to this summer's wheat harvest have increased the amount of money circulating in the market.“This (wage) increase is all but wiped out following the increases in fuel prices and recent depreciation in the Syrian pound,” Karam Shaar, nonresident senior fellow at Washington-based think tank the Newlines Institute, told the AP. “(It) will feed into local (market) prices in a month or two fully.”Syria’s uprising turned-civil war, now in its 13th year, and Western-led sanctions have pulverized the country’s economy. In February a deadly 7.8 magnitude earthquake further devastated its already damaged homes, water, and electricity infrastructure, especially in the ruined city of Aleppo. Experts say that the Syrian government’s rampant corruption and mismanagement of public funds have worsened matters.The United Nations estimates that 90% of Syrians in government-held areas live in poverty. More than half the population — some 12 million people — struggle to put food on the table, the U.N. estimates.The figure is similar for a northwestern enclave still held by the opposition.In recent months, Arab governments that once endorsed Assad’s removal have restored relations with Damascus. Syria was welcomed back to the Arab League in May, after a suspension lasting more than a decade for its crackdown on protesters.While there have been some early talks about a political solution that could lead to investment and aid from oil-rich Gulf monarchies, Western-led sanctions remain a key obstacle should any deals come to fruition.

Text Content: By Jonathan StempelAug 16 (Reuters) - Allstate agreed to pay $90 million to settle a class action lawsuit by shareholders who accused the insurer of defrauding them by concealing that it lowered underwriting standards to boost growth.A preliminary settlement was filed on Monday in federal court in Chicago, and requires a judge's approval.The lawsuit came after Allstate on Aug. 3, 2015, reported unexpectedly high claims payouts from auto accidents, causing a larger-than-expected 38% decline in quarterly operating profit.Allstate's share price fell 10.1% the next day, wiping out $2.8 billion of market value.Shareholders said Allstate had falsely assured earlier in the year that claims had been increasing because of factors beyond its control, such as the economy and weather.They said the stock fell after it became clear that loosened underwriting standards were the cause.The Northbrook, Illinois-based insurer denied wrongdoing, but settled to avoid the burden, cost and uncertainty of litigation, according to the settlement.Allstate did not immediately respond on Wednesday to a request for comment. Its main auto insurance rivals include State Farm, Geico and Progressive.The lawsuit is led by pension and annuity funds associated with the Carpenter Funds of Oakland, California.Their law firms plan to seek up to $22.5 million from the settlement for legal fees and up to $4.6 million for expenses.Shareholders may recover an average 46 cents per share if a judge approves the fee and expense request.The case is In re Allstate Corp Securities Litigation, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois, No. 16-10510.

Text Content: BEIJING (Reuters) - China will strengthen the coordination of various policies to boost growth and meet this year's economic target, according to a cabinet meeting cited by state media on Wednesday.The meeting held on Wednesday comes amid China's mounting economic woes with a prolonged property crisis, deflationary pressure and slower growth in retail sales and industrial output.Tuesday's grim data has raised calls from China watchers for authorities to roll out major fiscal stimulus to get the economy back on more solid footing.Without giving details, the cabinet meeting chaired by premier Li Qiang said China would continue to introduce policies for boosting consumption and promoting investment.Economists see a downside trend for the world's second-biggest economy. Barclays was among a number of global banks to cut its forecasts for China's 2023 growth after weak activity data.Beijing pledged to boost the household consumption share of GDP to prop up economic growth as debt-fuelled investment in infrastructure and property has peaked and exports slumped due to weakening global demand.However, despite a slew of policy announcements about how to boost growth, without direct stimulus such as consumer vouchers and tax cuts, Chinese households have continued to build up savings and reduce borrowing - meaning demand remains sluggish."Prolonged weakness in property construction will add to destocking pressures in the industrial space and depress consumption demand as well," said Tao Wang, economist at UBS Investment Bank."In such a case, economic momentum may stay subdued in the rest of the year and China may miss this year's growth target of around 5%."(Reporting by Liangping Gao and Ryan Woo; Editing by Christina Fincher and Alison Williams)

The aim is for multinationals to pay a profit tax of at least 15%."We will join countries which refuse to allow corporate profits to be diverted into tax havens," Finance Minister Zbynek Stanjura said during a televised press conference.The bill has to be approved by the parliament and signed by the president to become a law.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s revenue missed estimates, signaling an uneven recovery for the world’s biggest internet arena as it grapples with rising Chinese economic turbulence and anemic consumer sentiment.The country’s largest company reported a less-than-expected 11% rise in revenue after sales from major divisions including gaming and cloud services fell well short of projections. Online advertising surged 34% — the fastest in almost five years — in part because of algorithmic tweaks and a favorable comparison with last year’s Covid trough.Shares in major stockholders Prosus NV and Naspers Ltd. — proxies for the Chinese social media company — fell about 3%. The lackluster results cast doubt over a long-awaited comeback for an embattled sector whose leaders from Tencent to Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. barely grew in 2022.Signs are mounting that the Chinese economy is faltering, a potent risk for tech leaders that traditionally rely heavily on the domestic market. Executives played down the potential fallout from stubbornly weak consumption, arguing that improvements in advertising technology targeting as well as Tencent’s breadth of data and services will help it grow faster than rivals. The WeChat operator, a barometer for the economy and industry through a business portfolio that spans entertainment and social media to finance, sustained double-digit sales growth for the second straight quarter.“Yes the economy is uncertain, but it’s been uncertain for the past couple of years,” Chief Strategy Officer James Mitchell told analysts on a conference call. “It was uncertain in the first half of this year, and we’ve been able to grow through that and we believe we will keep growing and going forward as we enhance the return on investment to advertisers.”Story continuesRead more: Tencent Says AI Model Coming This Year Is Among China’s BestRead more: China Is Hiding More and More Data From the Rest of the WorldTencent’s net income rose 41% to 26.2 billion yuan ($3.6 billion) in the second quarter, lagging the 32.3 billion yuan average estimate in part because of a 2.99 billion yuan fine levied on its fintech business by regulators. Revenue rose to 149.2 billion yuan for the three months ended June, also missing projections.Tencent and Alibaba, the twin stars of a once-freewheeling industry, have gained some $50 billion of market value since May’s end, propelled by expectations of a gradual return to the consistent growth they enjoyed before Beijing clamped down on its biggest private corporations and richest entrepreneurs from 2020.Keen to rejuvenate the world’s No. 2 economy, the government has in recent months signaled it’s ready to unfetter the sector and conclusively end an era of unpredictable diktats. That’s yet to translate into major policies, while Chinese consumer spending remains muted because of cloudy prospects for growth and employment.Alibaba last week reported a better-than-expected 14% revenue rise for the June quarter as all its main divisions returned to growth, but warned of economic volatility ahead. JD.com Inc. on Wednesday also reported faster-than-anticipated growth after a successful “6.18” summer shopping festival. But retail margins slid, reflecting intensifying competition. Its shares fell more than 4% in early trading in New York.What Bloomberg Intelligence SaysTencent beat 2Q adjusted operating-profit estimates by 5.4%, though its top-line miss raises further questions about the sustainability of the current growth trajectory. The profit beat was driven by a 430-bp across-the-board improvement in gross margins, with video accounts boosting advertising margins and Cloud margins likely improving as well. Although the weakness in games seems partially transitory, we still expect Tencent’s broader business to encounter rising headwinds as the year progresses.- Robert Lea and Tiffany Tam, analystsClick here for the research.Like Alibaba and JD, Tencent faces foes on multiple fronts: old-time rivals like Baidu Inc. and Meituan are vying for dominance of the Chinese internet thanks to the emergence of generative AI. Baidu has so far stolen much of the limelight of the post-ChatGPT race, debuting Ernie Bot in March. Tencent’s testing its own large language model among employees and said Wednesday it plans to unveil a proprietary artificial-intelligence model later this year that it believes will be among the country’s best.“It’s among the top leading foundation models produced in China,” said Martin Lau, the company’s president, on the second-quarter earnings call. “We are very relentlessly working on the upgrade and iteration to prepare it for launch at some point of time in the latter part of this year.”Abroad, ByteDance Ltd. and PDD Holdings Inc. continue to make strides, building on expansions that began when Alibaba and Tencent were forced to show restraint. Despite rising geopolitical tensions, apps like TikTok and Temu offer a template for older peers seeking to regain pre-crackdown heights.At home, the Chinese economy is worsening as Beijing grapples with property sector turmoil, rising debt and flagging domestic consumption.To tide it over, Tencent is intent on reviving mainstay businesses like gaming and advertising, while continuing to push cost cuts. This summer, the world’s biggest game publisher debuted blockbusters Valorant and Lost Ark in its home market, filling a long-empty pipeline after censors resumed licensing approvals last year. Executives have declared Valorant its most important game of the year, as Tencent set aside more than $100 million for content and esports for the Riot Games shooter over the next three years.Such new launches will test a rapidly saturating market, where younger players are increasingly drawn to anime games created by up-and-comers like Mihoyo Co. The maker of Genshin Impact just scored another hit with its April release of Honkai: Star Rail, which topped download charts in countries from China to Japan and the US.Tencent’s international gaming revenue rose in the quarter while domestic sales plateaued, reflecting healthier spending abroad. Beijing this year moved to further limit time spent online by minors, adding to already strict gaming curbs.“For the first quarter, Honor of Kings offered a load of in-game items to players, a momentum that was hard to keep up in the second quarter,” said Shawn Yang, managing director at Blue Lotus Capital Advisors, speaking of Tencent’s mainstay mobile title. “New releases, in the meantime, are not as competitive as those from NetEase and Mihoyo.”--With assistance from Jane Zhang, Sarah Zheng, Henry Ren, Mayumi Negishi and Peter Elstrom.(Updates with share action and breakdowns from the second paragraph)©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: By Siddharth CavaleNEW YORK (Reuters) - Big-box retailer Target said on Wednesday that losses caused by theft and organized retail crime, which had spiked in the first half of the year, are showing signs of stabilizing.Target shares were up 3.5% at $129.40 in afternoon trading after the company's second-quarter profit exceeded analysts' expectations earlier on Wednesday.In May, Target had warned that theft and organized retail crime was hurting profitability and could reduce it by more than $500 million, on top of the $650 million in losses it incurred in 2022.Organized retail crime is defined as the phenomenon when gangs of thieves coordinate to steal millions of dollars of merchandise - often perfume, cosmetics, electronics or power drills - from retailers to then resell it on the black market. The reselling is generally at online auction sites and flea markets, and can even be done via third-party merchants on marketplaces like Amazon.com and Walmart.com.While rising theft is impacting all retailers, including Walmart and Home Depot, Target has been the most vocal about the issue as it has struggled with excess inventories and disappointing margins. Its large concentration of stores in urban areas also makes it more vulnerable to higher levels of crime, analysts said.Target said on Wednesday that losses stemming from theft dented margins by nearly 1 percentage point in the second quarter, a trend it expects to continue next quarter but ease as it enters the last two months of the year."So far, we've only seen indications that loss rates might soon be reaching a plateau, but have not yet seen evidence that loss rates will begin to come down," Target CFO Michael Fiddelke told analysts on a conference call on Wednesday. He said the company would not be changing its $500 million inventory-loss forecast for the year.The Minneapolis-based retailer has also had a spike in violent theft and confrontations between employees and customers at its stores. Threats and thefts involving violence at stores jumped 120% in the first five months of the year, Target CEO Brian Cornell said, calling it a trend that was "moving in the wrong direction."Story continuesSome of the threats were related to the company's LGBTQ Pride merchandise and were not all associated with theft, the company said. Target was embroiled in a controversy over its LGBTQ-themed merchandise in May that forced it to pull products from shelves after facing threatening behavior from shoppers.Cornell on Wednesday said Target was working "tirelessly" with retail industry groups and communities to improve the safety of staff and customers.Huntington Private Bank Senior Equity Analyst David Klink said it was encouraging to see Target increase its gross margins despite its struggles with retail theft. Target's gross margin rate came in at 27%, or 5.5 percentage points higher than a year ago, and an improvement from the 26.3% in the prior quarter.Klink, whose firm owns more than $10 million in Target shares, said he was disappointed earlier this year with the company's first-quarter margin growth and the fact that it blamed the weakness on retail theft."If it's weak (margins) and you claim it's 'organized crime,' that raises eyebrows – the reverse not so much ... So even holding the line on gross margins is a big positive for Target," Klink said on Wednesday.(Reporting by Siddharth Cavale in New York; Additional reporting by Savyata Mishra in Bengaluru; Editing by Matthew Lewis)

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Norway’s $1.4 trillion sovereign wealth fund isn’t budging in its view on commercial real estate even as soaring borrowing costs and falling values ravage the sector, Chief Executive Officer Nicolai Tangen said.“We have seen a lot of the damage in this area,” Tangen said in an interview on Bloomberg TV Wednesday. “We’ve had rates increasing already, we have seen higher vacancy rates, we’ve seen the whole Covid effect, we’ve seen the banks having troubles and so I suspect that we may have seen a lot of the bad news now.”Poor returns in unlisted property and renewable energy infrastructure pulled down the wealth fund’s performance in the first half of the year, forcing it to miss its benchmark by 23 basis points. It owned stakes in 390 properties at the end of 2022, including buildings on Hudson Street in New York, Regent Street in London and the Sony Center in Berlin.The fund’s 345 billion-krone ($33 billion) unlisted real estate portfolio fell 4.6% in the six months through June as higher vacancies in the office sector, and in the US in particular, pushed values down sharply, it said.Read More: AI Wave Boosts Returns for Norway’s $1.4 Trillion FundWhile not all the bad news has been priced in yet, “we for sure have taken some pretty big write downs on property portfolios, so there’s already quite a bit of damage in there,” Tangen said. The fund’s investments in logistics properties “continue to perform really well.”After the fund took a hit on the collapse of SVB Financial Group’s Silicon Valley Bank, Tangen told lawmakers in April that he was focused on minimizing exposure to so-called rotten apples going forward. Part of that work has touched on property stocks, he said on Wednesday.Story continuesRead More: Norway’s $1.4 Trillion Fund Targets ‘Rotten Apples’ in SVB Wake“We are continuously trying to find them and earlier in the year we were out of the Adani Group in India,” he said, adding that the fund has “been out of a big Swedish property management company which went bad.”Tangen was speaking about troubled landlord SBB, more formally known as Samhallsbyggnadsbolaget i Norden AB, according to the fund.Sweden’s commercial landlords are particularly under pressure from higher borrowing costs that hurt their ability to service debts after years of leveraged growth. That’s led to credit-rating downgrades and pushed companies into talks with bondholders on easing terms, as well as property divestments and other ways of raising cash.The fund was invested in 21 Swedish real estate firms at the end of 2022 — the most recent available data. It had cut the stake in SBB during 2022 to 0.07% from 1.52%, finishing the year with $2 million in that stock.Created in the 1990s to invest Norway’s oil and gas revenues abroad, the fund — also known as Norges Bank Investment Management — is the world’s biggest single owner of equities. While stocks make up 70% of its portfolio, it also invests in property, renewable energy infrastructure and bonds. It discloses a list of individual holdings once a year.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Former US Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers cautioned that the recent run-up in 10-year yields may have further to go, and that pressures are building to keep those benchmark rates much higher than experienced over the past two decades.“I don’t particularly see the current level of longer-term rates as any kind of peak,” Summers said on Bloomberg Television’s Wall Street Week with David Westin. Summers said that conclusion is based in part on expectations for bigger government budget deficits “to come into focus” for investors over time.Ten-year US Treasury yields this week approached the levels reached in October, when they hit the highest since 2007, and were at 4.19% as of 10:34 a.m. in New York. Over the past two decades, they’ve averaged about 2.90%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Summers, a Harvard University professor and paid contributor to Bloomberg TV, said he thinks of 10-year yields as offering compensation for three distinct factors:Adding up the three components, then it’s likely investors over the next decade will be “looking at 4.75 on the 10-year — and it obviously could end up being higher than that,” Summers said. While “nobody knows” how things will turn out, the former Treasury chief highlighted that many elements apparent today suggest that the economy is in a different era.Story continuesEmployers have relatively high demand for workers, and workers appear to be increasingly empowered in their talks with companies, he said. There has also been a change in the previous trend of “growing competitive pressure from globalization” that helped to hold costs down, he said.Summers said “I would guess that these higher long-term rates are with us to stay — and if I had to bet, I think I bet that they’re more likely to go higher, than to go lower.”©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Renamed Coinbase Derivatives Exchange, it currently sends traders to buy futures from third-parties such as brokers. But with the NFA approval, Coinbase will be able to provide these same derivatives to users directly, first via Coinbase’s main app.The offering will let Coinbase dig deeper into a huge market. Cryptocurrency derivatives accounted for 78.2% of total crypto trading volume on centralized exchanges in July, according to researcher CCData. Part of the derivatives’ appeal is that traders can use leverage to buy them. Coinbase will offer leverage, but hasn’t disclosed any details on that yet.In the US, exchanges such as CME and LedgerX already offer crypto derivatives.The approval comes amid Coinbase’s legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC sued Coinbase in June for operating an unregistered national securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency, as well as for selling unregistered securities. Coinbase said the agency doesn’t make registration possible.Story continues“Where regulations are clear and sensible, we will work with regulators to receive the authorizations needed to offer products that align with our purpose of using crypto to update the financial system to advance economic freedom and opportunity,” Greg Tusar, head of institutional products at Coinbase, said in a blog post.Coinbase already recently rolled out derivatives overseas. In May, it announced Coinbase International Exchange, letting institutional users based in eligible jurisdictions outside of the US to trade perpetual futures. International Exchange handled $2.52 billion in trading volume in the last 30 days, according to its Website.Shares of Coinbase rose about 3% in early trading. The stock has more than doubled this year, after tumbling 86% in 2022.(Adds pre-market trading.

Text Content: By Camillus EbohABUJA (Reuters) - Nigeria's suspended central bank governor Godwin Emefiele will appear in a high court in Abuja on Thursday, when he is expected to enter a plea in a 20-count indictment, a government lawyer said on Wednesday.Government lawyers, on Tuesday, said they had filed additional graft charges against the governor, including allegedly "conferring unlawful advantages" and "unlawful procurement".Emefiele is being charged alongside a central bank employee and a private firm for the alleged illegal procurement of 98 luxury vehicles and armoured buses, according to papers filed by the public prosecutor.Local papers said the central bank employee was a director in the private company. Neither the employee, who was not named in court documents, or Emefiele, who is in detention, were immediately available for comment.Emefiele, suspended by President Bola Tinubu in June, had already pleaded not guilty to charges of possessing a firearm illegally, which were subsequently withdrawn.Government lawyers said they withdrew the firearm charge "because of emerging facts pending further investigations."A judge in Lagos granted him bail following his plea on July 25 but he was immediately rearrested.Tinubu, who is embarking on the boldest reforms in Africa's biggest economy in more than a decade, has launched a probe of the central bank under Emefiele after criticising its policies at his inauguration in May, especially moves to prop up the naira currency.($1 = 784.39 naira)(Reporting by Camillus Eboh; Writing by Chijioke Ohuocha; Editing by Sharon Singleton)

Text Content: WASHINGTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - U.S. single-family homebuilding surged in July amid an acute shortage of previously owned houses, but mortgage rates climbing back to near two-decade highs could stifle demand for new construction.Single-family housing starts, which account for the bulk of homebuilding, jumped 6.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 983,000 units last month, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday. Data for June was revised to show starts falling to a rate of 921,000 units, instead of 935,000 units as previously reported.The housing market, pummeled by the Federal Reserve's aggressive monetary policy tightening, had in recent months shown signs of stabilizing at a lower level, with homebuilding and new home sales even rising.But further improvement looks likely to be curtailed by the renewed increase in mortgage rates.The average rate on the popular 30-year fixed mortgage has increased to 6.96% over the past weeks, according to data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac. The rate is within striking distance of the 7.08% seen in late October and early November, which was the highest since April 2002.Mortgage rates near 7% were attributed to the ebb in confidence among homebuilders in August, with the National Association of Home Builders noting that more builders were offering incentives to attract buyers amid expectations of lower sales.Starts for housing projects with five units or more were unchanged at a rate of 460,000 units in July. Demand for rental accommodation, largely driven by higher mortgage rates sidelining some potential home buyers, is slowing. There is also a huge stock of multi-family housing under construction.Overall housing starts increased 3.9% to a rate of 1.452 million units in July. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast starts rising to a rate of 1.448 million units.Permits for future construction of single-family homes rose 0.6% in July to a rate of 930,000 units.

Text Content: (Adds details on meeting, background about growth and stimulus)BEIJING, Aug 16 (Reuters) - China will strengthen the coordination of various policies to boost growth and meet this year's economic target, according to a cabinet meeting cited by state media on Wednesday.The meeting held on Wednesday comes amid China's mounting economic woes with a prolonged property crisis, deflationary pressure and slower growth in retail sales and industrial output.Tuesday's grim data has raised calls from China watchers for authorities to roll out major fiscal stimulus to get the economy back on more solid footing.Without giving details, the cabinet meeting chaired by premier Li Qiang said China would continue to introduce policies for boosting consumption and promoting investment.Economists see a downside trend for the world's second-biggest economy. Barclays was among a number of global banks to cut its forecasts for China's 2023 growth after weak activity data.Beijing pledged to boost the household consumption share of GDP to prop up economic growth as debt-fuelled investment in infrastructure and property has peaked and exports slumped due to weakening global demand.However, despite a slew of policy announcements about how to boost growth, without direct stimulus such as consumer vouchers and tax cuts, Chinese households have continued to build up savings and reduce borrowing - meaning demand remains sluggish."Prolonged weakness in property construction will add to destocking pressures in the industrial space and depress consumption demand as well," said Tao Wang, economist at UBS Investment Bank."In such a case, economic momentum may stay subdued in the rest of the year and China may miss this year's growth target of around 5%."

Text Content: Amazon Pharmacy (AMZN) announced Tuesday it will be the latest healthcare player to sell some insulins to diabetes patients for $35 in what the company said is an effort to add more transparency to drug costs.The company said in its announcement it will use automatic coupons to offer patients a final price on some insulins for as little as $35, similar to offerings from some pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and directly from the biggest manufacturers.In an interview with Yahoo Finance, Amazon Pharmacy chief medical officer Dr. Vin Gupta said the automatic coupons are a key differentiator."People either don't know about [these discounts] or simply can't get access to it because there's some sort of inefficiency, and that's what we're solving for," Gupta said.Amazon is offering the same discount insulin product manufacturers including Novo Nordisk (NVO), Eli Lilly (LLY), Sanofi (SNY), DexCom (DXCM), and Insulet (PODD) are offering for about 15 insulin products.Some manufacturers also offer insulin for as low as $25 and have programs for those eligible to get the products for free.But these discounts from other companies entail a multi-step process to activate or redeem the discounted price. As a clinician, Gupta said he has seen how frustrating the lack of transparency can be for patients."The solutions exist. Coupons have long existed ... far before Amazon Pharmacy, frankly, ever existed. We recognize that," Gupta said.The move Tuesday also marks Amazon's latest expansion in healthcare under CEO Andy Jassy.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.The e-commerce giant acquired healthcare provider One Medical earlier this year and announced its telehealth services would now be available in 50 states. The pharmacy offerings have also expanded this year to include Prime membership pricing for select drugs, as well as discounts on generics and some branded drugs.In addition to the private sector efforts, the Inflation Reduction Act set a cap of $35 for insulin products for Medicare beneficiaries. Lobbying efforts by the American Diabetes Association have also helped pass state-level caps as low as $25 per month for state-regulated health plans, according to ADA CEO Chuck Henderson.Story continuesHenderson told Yahoo Finance that while the drugmakers have offered lower capped prices, "we need more transparency. We need more people to be disruptive like an Amazon Pharmacy."Insulin pens manufactured by the Novo Nordisk company.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Former Bridgewater Associates LP executive Bob Elliott is expanding his firm’s ETF lineup with a variety of hedge fund-like strategies.Elliott’s Unlimited, which focuses on alternative investments, is planning to launch eight exchange-traded funds that aim to replicate the returns of styles such as equity long-short, global macro and low beta, according to regulatory filings. The goal is to offer individual investors access to more sophisticated strategies at a lower cost relative to fees charged by private funds.The executive, who spent over a decade at Ray Dalio’s investment firm, last year launched the nearly $40 million Unlimited HFND Multi-Strategy Return Tracker ETF (ticker HFND) — which focuses on a number of styles using machine learning.Elliott declined to comment on the new funds, citing a regulatory quiet period.Each fund will invest primarily in ETFs and futures contracts. Unlimited will determine the returns of the various hedge fund sectors, and use an algorithm that utilizes historical returns and positioning data to build ETF portfolios that best match each sector’s returns, according to the filing.Shana Sissel, president of Banrion Capital Management, said she’s encouraged that Elliott’s fund lineup is bringing retail investors strategies that can provide better diversification.“I’m very encouraged at his initial success,” she said, “But I’m concerned because this is a space where retail investors performance chase, and quickly things can turn.”Indeed, the new funds come during a year when many hedge funds have underperformed stock and bond markets.Hedge-fund veteran George Noble is shuttering his long-short equity ETF that has plunged more than 50% since its September debut. The Noble Absolute Return ETF (ticker NOPE) held positions against a number of tech stocks that have posted staggering advances in 2023.Story continuesMeantime, HFND is up only 0.2% this year, compared with a 16% advance in the S&P 500.“While the underlying technology has worked largely consistent with our expectations, hedge funds have not performed as well as index funds over the last nine months because they have been positioned more conservatively,” said Elliott. “As a result, advisors who see the promise of the fund over time have been slower to make allocations until there is more evidence of differentiated performance.”©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- BAE Systems Plc is in talks about a possible acquisition of Ball Corp.’s aerospace division, people with knowledge of the matter said, in what would be the year’s largest acquisition by a UK corporate.The London-listed defense giant is in discussions with the US packaging group about the terms of a takeover of the unit, which manufactures instruments and sensors for everything from space travel to weather forecasting, according to the people. A deal could value Ball’s aerospace operations at more than $4 billion, they said.Deliberations are ongoing and there’s no certainty they’ll lead to an agreement, the people said. Another bidder could also emerge, they said. A representative for BAE said the company regularly reviews its portfolio, declining to comment further. A spokesperson for Ball couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.Reuters reported last month that BAE was among a group of parties interested in the Ball business.Britain’s top defense contractor, BAE has seen its shares rise almost a fifth this year as governments increase military spending. The company, which makes products including Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers and Eurofighter Typhoon jets, this month raised its forecast for sales, profit and cash flow.BAE’s pursuit of Ball’s aerospace unit comes as growing security threats across the globe spur a dealmaking rush in the defense sector that’s defying the broader drop off in mergers and acquisitions activity.The value of transactions involving aerospace and defense companies has risen 4% to $35 billion over the last 12 months, Bloomberg-compiled data show. Deals have included L3Harris Technologies Inc.’s $4.7 billion purchase of rocket engine maker Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc.Story continuesWestminster, Colorado-based Ball said in June that it was exploring options for its aerospace unit. A sale would allow Ball to focus on its core packaging operations and reduce debt, which grew substantially following its multibillion-dollar purchase of Rexam Plc in 2016. The company has steadily sold assets since, including its Russian operations to Arnest Group for $530 million last year.--With assistance from Siddharth Philip.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: By Neil Jerome MoralesMANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines' gambling industry is set to double its gross gaming revenue by 2028, as the country attracts more tourists such as wealthy Chinese gamblers, the gaming regulator's chief said on Wednesday.At least six new casino facilities worth roughly around $3 billion are in the pipeline to boost the Southeast Asian nation's freewheeling gaming industry ahead of competition from Japan, which has a sprawling casino set for construction, and Thailand, which is planning to legalise gambling.The country's gaming sector will likely post at least 10% annual growth in gross gaming revenue (GGR), which is projected to post a new record high this year and hit 450 billion to 500 billion pesos ($7.9 to $8.8 billion) in five years' time, Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp (Pagcor) Chairman Alejandro Tengco told Reuters.Total GGR, a key metric in the industry representing the amount players wager minus their winnings, hit a record 256 billion in 2019 and was poised for further growth until the coronavirus pandemic decimated the industry. GGR started recovering in 2021 and reached 214 billion in 2022."Currently, the strong performance is supported by a stable of local players," Tengco said. "There is still an opportunity for the foreign market to increase further due to improving foreign travel guidelines."However, long-term projections could be dampened by headwinds such as more armed conflicts between countries, proliferation of illegal gambling, and an economic downturn, Tengco said.The Philippine gambling scene, which includes a smaller version of the Las Vegas gaming strip located in the capital, attracts high rollers from countries like China, Japan and South Korea. It has enticed foreign and domestic firms to set up billion-dollar integrated casino-resorts.Adding to four sprawling casinos operating in the capital, six more gaming facilities are expected to be put up across the country, Tengco said.Story continuesIt includes an up to $2 billion casino and golf course in Pampanga province, a $300 million project by Bloomberry Resorts in Cavite province, and a $300 million by Global-Estate Resorts in holiday island Boracay, Pagcor data shows.While planned casinos in Thailand and Japan are seen as threats, the Philippines is beefing up its status as a preferred destination by privatising state-owned casinos, new gaming projects, and policy reforms, Tengco said.($1 = 56.6520 Philippine pesos)(Reporting by Neil Jerome Morales; Editing by Alison Williams)

Text Content: (Adds details, context, analysts)By Davide BarbusciaNEW YORK, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Deflationary pressures in China could spill over into global markets, which is potentially near-term good news for Western central banks as they seek to curb inflation, U.S. asset manager PIMCO said on Wednesday.China's consumer sector fell into deflation and factory-gate prices extended declines in July, as the world's second-largest economy struggled to revive demand and a flurry of policies to support the economy failed to shore up activity.The economic deterioration could moderate inflation in China and, increasingly, also in the markets served by Chinese goods, PIMCO Economist and Managing Director Tiffany Wilding said in a note."Persistent deflation in China would likely spill over to developed markets, as a weaker yuan and an elevated inventory-to-sales ratios lower the cost of Chinese goods abroad – a development central bankers in developed markets would likely welcome," she said.“Given the usual lags, deflationary spillovers have likely only just begun to impact global consumer markets, with discounting likely to accelerate over the coming quarters.”The Chinese central bank cut key policy rates on Tuesday for the second time in three months to boost the economy, but investors have so far been unimpressed.Oxford Economics said in a note on Wednesday that it had reduced its 2023 gross domestic product growth forecast for China to a below-consensus 5.1%."Deflation, weakening trade, collapsing loan demand, and a paralysed property sector dampen our risk appetite," it said.On Wednesday, data showed China's new home prices fell for the first time this year in July, as policy support failed to shore up the embattled property sector.Meanwhile, a senior official told investors that Zhongrong International Trust Co., a leading Chinese trust firm, had missed repayments on dozens of investment products since late last month, adding to fears the country's property crisis would have a wider impact in the financial sector."For China, the risk of more pronounced deflationary pressure depends crucially on the government’s policies in the coming months," said Wilding."Adequate fiscal stimulus to boost domestic demand may reaccelerate inflation, while delayed or inadequate policy measures could lead to a downward spiral," she said.

Text Content: (Adds context, comments from ABPA president)By Ana ManoSAO PAULO, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Accelerated Brazilian chicken production will continue at least through the end of 2024, according to a lobby group for chicken and pork processors on Wednesday, in a sign that a global chicken glut may not subside soon.An oversupplied chicken market affected Brazilian meatpackers' earnings in recent quarters, and also forced companies like Tyson Foods in the United States to shut capacity.ABPA, which represents companies like JBS SA and BRF SA, said Brazil's 2023 chicken output could potentially increase by up to 3% to 14.95 million tonnes at the end of the year.Next year, chicken output may grow as much as 4.5% to 15.5 million tonnes, it added.Brazil, one of the world's largest chicken producers alongside China, the United States and the European Union, was previously expected to produce 15 million tonnes of chicken in 2023, said Ricardo Santin, ABPA's president.He told reporters that new projections already reflect a gradual reduction of Brazil's output, which should improve the balance of supply and demand in the second half compared with the first.Given the size of Brazil's production and exports, the country "is a price and volume driver on global markets," he said.Brazilian chicken exports, which account for 35.6% of global chicken supplies, are also expected to rise.ABPA is projecting Brazilian chicken exports at 5.1 million to 5.2 million tonnes for end-2023, potentially increasing up to 8% from the previous year.For 2024, exports could grow as much as 5% to 5.35 million tonnes, ABPA said.Brazil's main export destinations were China, Japan, the United Arab Emirates, South Africa and Saudi Arabia in the first seven months of 2023.China, which increased imports of Brazilian chicken by 33% in the period, is expected to continue buying large volumes from suppliers in the country as it is expected to lower its own internal chicken output, ABPA said.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Adriana Cisneros has been obsessed with satellites ever since she was a child in Venezuela. Now, after a decade of leading her billionaire family’s conglomerate, she’s turned that obsession into one of her biggest bets yet.Cisneros Group, which holds assets ranging from the wildly popular Miss Venezuela pageant to a luxury resort development in the Dominican Republic, is expanding with an investment in AST SpaceMobile Inc. Founded by a fellow Venezuelan, it seeks to offer a space-based broadband cellular network from its patented satellite technology, bringing telecommunication services to rural parts of the world.So far, it’s been a rocky experience — AST has shed nearly 70% of its value since going public via a blank-check company in 2021, including a 16% plunge on Tuesday. But Cisneros, 43, is convinced the investment will pay off.She led the Series A round for the Midland, Texas-based company with a $10 million initial investment and then helped bring in big-name backers like Vodafone Group Plc, Rakuten Group Inc. and American Towers. The company launched its first satellite in September and has signed deals with the world’s leading telecom companies, she said. Cisneros has a 4.7% stake in the firm that’s currently worth about $38 million.Read More: Musk, Rivals Edge Closer to Satellite Phones After FCC Nod“If AST works, it’s going to be bigger than anything I’ve — that we’ve ever touched at Cisneros,” she said recently in an interview from the group’s Miami headquarters.That would be a tall order.During the second half of the 20th century, the Cisneros family was one of the most powerful and wealthy in Latin America from their base in Venezuela. A small material-transport business founded by Adriana’s grandfather, Diego Cisneros, grew into a giant holding company that represented well-known brands from the US including Pepsi, Studebaker cars and Pizza Hut franchises.Story continuesHer father Gustavo, now 78 and retired, turned Cisneros Group into a media powerhouse with the Venevision TV network that produced and broadcast soap operas and other shows around the world, including the Miss Venezuela beauty pageant. Wary of increased political turmoil in Venezuela in the late 1990s and the need to fulfill contracts to produce hundreds of hours of content, he relocated the company and his family to Miami, a move that proved prescient given the volatility that followed the election of Hugo Chavez.He helped build Univision, the Spanish-language network, before eventually exiting for a profit in 2007. The group also took a stake in satellite TV provider DirecTV — an investment that allowed Adriana to witness the launch of a satellite that would beam cable television across Latin America — which it sold around the same time.As Adriana Cisneros begins her second decade in charge of the conglomerate, she said the same spirit that drove her grandfather and father to build and sell businesses is very much alive.‘Quite Opportunistic’While Venevision still produces news and vies for live sports rights in Venezuela, it no longer creates big-budget soap operas and total headcount there has fallen 80% to 600 employees. Investments have picked up recently, however, as advertisers return following a rocky decade.Many family businesses in Latin America struggle to make it past the third generation, but theirs has been “quite opportunistic,” she said.“Decade by decade we would identify trends, geographies, industries that we thought were interesting and then we would do deep dives in those and then exit, move on or keep some,” Cisneros said.After taking over in 2013, she built a digital ad sales business in Latin America that grew through a partnership with Meta Platforms Inc. to eventually have $500 million of annual revenue. She sold it in 2021 to Entravision.With part of the proceeds, she recently bought a 25% stake in the Electric Factory, a Uruguay-based startup that uses artificial intelligence, virtual reality and metaverse initiatives to build tech strategies for companies.“I’m really going to be very focused on trying to build that business up to be a proper global player,” she said.Miss VenezuelaShe currently sits on the boards of AST, the Electric Factory and Mattel Inc. after receiving an invitation from long-time acquaintance Ynon Kreiz, the toy company’s chief executive officer who’s basking in the success of the recently released Barbie movie.Some of the takeaways from Barbie’s success are applicable to the Cisneros Group’s strategy around the Miss Venezuela business, she said.Miss Venezuela is like the Super Bowl for Venezuelans, she said. It’s no longer just a one-night event and instead unfolds over six months with content about the contestants that produces more revenue and brings in major brands.A Venevision super app will be rolled out soon to expand offerings not only to Venezuelans at home but also to the nearly 8 million that have left over the last few decades. Miss Venezuela will be a large part of the offering and ads will be sold in the location where viewers are watching.“There’s a huge global community of Venezuelans now in all the major cities and they also want to feel connected with home,” she said. “It’s a really cool multiplatform mega-experience that made it really interesting for us to start investing again in our TV network in Venezuela because our audience is global now.”Dominican ResortCisneros Group doesn’t publish financial information and she declined to comment on annual revenue figures. The company has 800 full-time employees and offices in Miami, New York, the Dominican Republic, Venezuela and Spain.Besides the media and startup investments, the family is developing a $200 million real estate project in the Dominican Republic on land northwest of Punta Cana purchased over the past 35 years.Tropicalia, as the project is known, will have 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) of beachfront, a five-star hotel, private residences and a golf course. Construction is underway, though it could take 50 years to fully develop the land — some 2,590 acres — she said.Back in Miami, the walls of Cisneros Group’s headquarters in the city’s Downtown neighborhood are decorated with artwork from the family’s collection. Adriana’s mother, Patricia Phelps de Cisneros, is a prominent collector of contemporary Latin American art and has donated hundreds of pieces to museums, including MoMA in New York and the Reina Sofia in Madrid.The youngest of three children, Adriana said the conversation with her father to take over the business lasted about four years. Her brother and sister aren’t involved. If there were any doubts who’s in charge, a placard on her desk reads “La Jefa” — The Boss.“We’ve sold all of our businesses that people thought we would never sell,” she said. “Now we’re going to do it again.”©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- The US 30-year mortgage rate rose to 7.16% last week, matching the highest since 2001 and crimping both sales and refinancing activity.The contract rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage rose 7 basis points to 7.16% in the week ended Aug. 11, according to Mortgage Bankers Association data out Wednesday. The gauge of home-purchase applications slipped for a fifth-straight week to the second-lowest level since 1995.The latest jump in borrowing costs presents a fresh headwind for the housing market, just as the sector had been showing signs of finding its footing. The impact from high mortgage rates is two-fold: it restrains demand and keeps many Americans who are sitting on lower mortgage rates from listing their homes.A lack of homes listed for sale are also pushing prices higher, with recent price gains helping the US housing market erase the roughly $3 trillion it lost in value during the past year’s slowdown, according to Redfin Corp. Price gains coupled with higher rates are squeezing affordability even more.“Many households that would like to move are trapped right now,” said James Knightley, ING’s chief international economist. “Consequently housing supply has fallen just as rapidly as housing demand, hence why prices have stabilized and are moving higher again in several areas.”Read more: US Housing Market Recoups $3 Trillion Lost in Recent SlowdownHigher rates could exacerbate inventory issues as owners seeking to move confront the prospect of giving up much lower rates. About nine in 10 owners with mortgages have interest rates under 6%, according to Redfin.The Federal Reserve’s efforts to tame inflation through higher interest rates led to a rapid deterioration in the sector last year, dragging down economic growth. Existing-home sales have remained tepid amid limited supply, but new-home sales have rebounded, supported by more available inventory.Story continuesThe pickup in the housing market has fueled more optimism among economists that the US may be able to avoid recession. Another report Wednesday showed new-home building rose last month, and applications to build single-family homes advanced to the highest in more than a year.But separate data on Tuesday showed homebuilder sentiment fell for the first time this year on concerns about higher borrowing costs.

Text Content: By Isla BinnieNEW YORK (Reuters) - Invenergy Renewables, Blackstone and Canada's second-largest pension fund said on Wednesday they struck a deal with Bank of America to help buy wind and solar plants worth $1.5 billion, capitalising on a new tax structure included in President Joe Biden's landmark climate law.Developers and investors are working on ways to take advantage of a provision in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act(IRA) which gives companies tax breaks for funding the clean energy projects which can help wean the world off fossil fuels.Invenergy said in a statement it agreed to sell tax credits worth $580 million to Bank of America, and put those funds towards buying 14 projects from American Electric Power.Policymakers hope the new system will bring more money from fresh sources into renewables projects which have long relied on a limited group of large banks which can handle the process of buying equity stakes and taking the associated tax breaks.This is the first large-scale transaction of its kind to be publicly announced, Bank of America's global head of sustainable finance Karen Fang said in the statement.It "creates a financeable transferability product that will be used to scale the growth of renewable energy," Fang said.Around $4 trillion will need to be spent on clean energy development globally each year by 2030 to allow the world's economies to cut greenhouse gas emissions to net zero, meaning no more than can be captured by natural sinks like forests or using technology, the International Energy Agency said.Analysts at investment bank Credit Suisse have estimated the IRA could lead to the generation of tax credits worth $576 billion by 2031.Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service published rules on how to regulate tax credit transfers in June, and they are expected to launch an online registry by the end of 2023.Private equity firm Blackstone has invested around $4 billion in Invenergy.

It also announced a 10% rise in quarterly dividend to 32 cents per share.Wall Street analysts had expected earnings per share of $1.88, per Refinitiv data.H&R Block's shares were last up 10% to $39.01, after rising as high as $39.52, their highest level since February this year. With Wednesday's gains, the stock has gained nearly 7% year-to-date.The median analyst target price on H&R Block is $42, according to Refinitiv data.

Text Content: (Adds further details, background in paragraphs 3-8)By Felix OnuahABUJA, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Nigeria's state-oil firm NNPC said on Wednesday it has secured a $3 billion crude oil repayment loan from Cairo-based Afrexim Bank that will support the government's reforms to stabilize the exchange rate market.A commitment letter and termsheet was signed on Wednesday for an emergency $3 billion crude oil repayment loan, the state-oil firm posted on X, formerly known as Twitter.The NNPC in a post tagged "relief for the naira", said the loan will immediately disburse funds to support the "government in its ongoing fiscal and monetary policy reforms aimed at stabilizing the exchange rate market".Africa's largest economy has been looking to shore up its reserves and stem the fall of its currency, which has hit record lows on the black market two months after trading restrictions were loosened on the official market.Acting central bank governor Folashodun Shonubi said on Monday the bank will take measures that will impact currency markets in days after meeting President Bola Tinubu to discuss ways to improve dollar liquidity on the official market.Shonubi did not spell out what measures would be taken but said the president was concerned about the black market rate being a reference rate for local use and its inflation impact.Tinubu, who embarked on the boldest reforms in decades, axed a costly fuel subsidy and devalued the naira, reviving foreign investor interest in the country, which has suffered from high inflation and a soaring debt-servicing cost burden.But foreign investors have yet to return.

Text Content: (Recasts to lead with Japanese yen, updates prices, adds FX table, adds WASHINGTON dateline) By Hannah Lang and Samuel Indyk WASHINGTON/LONDON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The Japanese yen further weakened against the dollar on Wednesday, hovering in a zone that last year triggered intervention, while the yuan slipped to a nine-month trough as concerns mounted about the extent of China's slowdown. The yen has hit the key 145 per dollar level for four sessions now, a zone that triggered heavy dollar selling by Japanese authorities in September and October last year. It last weakened 0.13% versus the greenback to 145.75 per dollar, after hitting 145.940 earlier in the session, a level not seen since November. Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki said on Tuesday authorities were not targeting absolute currency levels for intervention. "Markets are concerned whether the Bank of Japan will intervene or whether dollar-yen needs to go all the way up to 150," said Niels Christensen, chief analyst at Nordea. "They have not been so loud in the last week, but the threat of intervention is why the market has been a little bit hesitant to push dollar-yen up." Elsewhere in Asia, the yuan touched its lowest level since November in both the onshore and offshore markets, falling as low as 7.3379. That extended Tuesday's decline following Chinese data that missed forecasts and prompted Beijing to deliver unexpected cuts to its key policy rates as authorities there sought to shore up an economy that has rapidly lost steam in recent months. The Australian dollar, often used as a liquid proxy for the yuan, plumbed nine-month lows in response to the Chinese data. "I really don't think that the backdrop is conducive for a sustained risk rally at this point," said Bipan Rai, global head of FX strategy at CIBC Capital Markets. "Not only the China data, it's also the fact that we're dealing with tighter monetary conditions globally, and that's going to crimp demand at the margin." CENTRAL BANK WATCH The pound was up after data showed British core inflation stayed strong in July, hitting a high of $1.2768 and was last up around 0.45% at $1.2759. Core inflation in Britain, which strips out volatile energy and food prices, remained at 6.9% in July, flat versus the June reading, and higher than expectations in a Reuters poll for a reading of 6.8%. The dollar index was off 0.087% at 103.100, though it was not far from an over one-month peak hit on Monday, driven by higher bond yields following upbeat U.S. data. The euro gained 0.12% to $1.0917. The New Zealand dollar, which had fallen to a nine-month low of $0.5932 in early Asian trade, rebounded after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand policy meeting, to trade higher by 0.11% versus the greenback at $0.596. The central bank held its cash rate steady as expected on Wednesday, but slightly pushed out when it expects to start cutting borrowing costs to 2025. "The statement gave a clearly more hawkish tone, likely defying any dovish expectations," said Barclays research analyst Shreya Sodhani. "We think today's more hawkish statement and the governor's press conference suggest that the timing of rate cuts will likely be pushed back a bit." ======================================================== Currency bid prices at 10:30AM (1430 GMT) Description RIC Last U.S. Close Pct Change YTD Pct High Bid Low Bid Previous Change Session Dollar index 103.1000 103.2100 -0.09% -0.377% +103.2800 +102.9400 Euro/Dollar $1.0915 $1.0904 +0.12% +1.89% +$1.0934 +$1.0896 Dollar/Yen 145.7600 145.5700 +0.12% +11.16% +145.9100 +145.3100 Euro/Yen 159.11 158.74 +0.23% +13.41% +159.2000 +158.6400 Dollar/Swiss 0.8791 0.8786 +0.06% -4.92% +0.8814 +0.8775 Sterling/Dollar $1.2759 $1.2702 +0.45% +5.50% +$1.2766 +$1.2689 Dollar/Canadian 1.3515 1.3497 +0.16% -0.23% +1.3518 +1.3476 Aussie/Dollar $0.6452 $0.6456 -0.04% -5.33% +$0.6481 +$0.6429 Euro/Swiss 0.9596 0.9579 +0.18% -3.02% +0.9611 +0.9577 Euro/Sterling 0.8553 0.8583 -0.35% -3.29% +0.8593 +0.8555 NZ $0.5957 $0.5951 +0.11% -6.17% +$0.5993 +$0.5932 Dollar/Dollar Dollar/Norway 10.5280 10.5370 -0.06% +7.31% +10.5440 +10.5010 Euro/Norway 11.4896 11.4852 +0.04% +9.49% +11.5100 +11.4425 Dollar/Sweden 10.8581 10.8523 +0.14% +4.33% +10.8803 +10.8259 Euro/Sweden 11.8525 11.8354 +0.14% +6.30% +11.8587 +11.8260 (Reporting by Hannah Lang in Washington and Samuel Indyk in London; additional reporting by Rae Wee; Editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise, Barbara Lewis and Jonathan Oatis)

Source: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-natural-gas-futures-slip-151405853.html
Text Content: Aug 16 (Reuters) - U.S. natural gas futures fell over 2% to more than a one-week low on Wednesday on forecasts for cooler weather, especially in the northeastern part of the U.S. Front-month gas futures for September delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange were down 5.4 cents, or 2%, at $2.61 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) at 9:49 a.m. EDT (13:49 GMT), its lowest level since Aug. 7. The contract fell nearly 5% on Tuesday. Although the weather in the lower 48 states is forecast to remain hotter than normal through at least Aug. 31, it will be significantly milder during that period and heading into September than recently, especially in the heavily populated Northeast region. That is pulling back expectations for any late-season power sector demand for cooling, said Gary Cunningham, director of market research at Tradition Energy. Data provider Refinitiv forecast U.S. gas demand, including exports, would rise from 104.9 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) this week to 106.6 bcfd next week. These numbers were higher from Tuesday's forecast. Refinitiv said average gas output in the Lower 48 states was 101.8 bcfd so far in August, matching the reading in July, and not far from a monthly record of 102.2 bcfd in May. Gas flows to the seven big U.S. LNG export plants have fallen from an average of 12.7 bcfd in July to 12.4 bcfd so far in August, mainly due to reductions at Venture Global LNG's Calcasieu facility in Louisiana. That compares with a monthly record of 14.0 bcfd in April. Market participants were keeping a close watch on any updates on possible strikes at Australian liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities that would lead to supply disruptions. Gas prices in Europe were down 3.45 euros at 37.40 euros per megawatt hour (MWh) by 1421 GMT. Woodside Energy said "positive progress" was being made on wage disputes at Australia's largest LNG facility even as a union alliance said key differences remained ahead of further talks next Wednesday. The U.S. is on track to become the world's biggest LNG supplier in 2023 - ahead of recent leaders Australia and Qatar - as higher global prices feed demand for U.S. exports due to supply disruptions and sanctions linked to the war in Ukraine.

Text Content: The cost of healthcare in retirement is one of those great unknowns in life that no one wants to think about when they’re young and healthy. Rest assured, though, one day you’ll be there.The fact is that out-of-pocket medical bills will eat up more of your retirement budget than you can fathom. Fidelity’s retiree healthcare cost estimate shows that if you retire this year at age 65, you can expect to spend an average of $157,000 on medical expenses throughout retirement.So there's plenty to consider and plan for.For example, there's new data on Medicare drug inflation and what it means to retirees. And there are warning signs, in the latest government data, when it comes to assisted living. And, oh, watch out for the rules that govern how you take money out of your healthcare spending account (HSA).Here are a few things that came across my desk this week that you ought to pay attention to:Medicare drug costs are off the charts: The 25 top Medicare Part D drugs, on average, have more than tripled since they first entered the market, according to a new report out last week from AARP’s Public Policy Institute. That far surpasses "the corresponding rate of general inflation," according to the research.The surging cost of these medications — from a blood thinner to a formula that keeps joint damage from worsening for people with rheumatoid arthritis — can be particularly tough for Medicare Part D enrollees who take an average of four or five prescription drugs every month, according to Leigh Purvis, prescription drug policy principal at the AARP Public Policy Institute, and author of the report.Fit as a fiddle. Staying healthy will be key in retirement with rising healthcare costs. (Getty Creative)Currently, prescription drugs account for about 20% of Medicare patients’ out-of-pocket healthcare costs, according to the Commonwealth Fund. Not surprising, then, that one in five older adults are not filling a prescription or skipping doses to save money on their medications, Purvis said."The rising cost of these drugs is crippling for retirees today, especially when so many Social Security recipients have only moderate or even no savings," Mary Johnson, a Social Security and Medicare policy analyst for The Senior Citizens League, told Yahoo Finance.Story continuesSee related story: Top savings tools — 4 alternatives to savings accountsHelp may be on the way. Maybe.The Inflation Reduction Act, a federal law passed last year that requires drug companies to pay a penalty to Medicare if their drug’s price increases faster than the rate of inflation, gives Medicare the ability to negotiate lower drug prices with drug companies for the first time. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services is expected to announce the first 10 drugs selected for negotiation by Sept. 1. The trouble is that the new prices won't become available until 2026.Nursing home costs? Don't ask: On top of stratospheric out-of-pocket bills for many prescription drugs, costs for nursing homes and adult care surged by the largest monthly amount in July, according to new inflation data.The latest report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released last Thursday showed that the costs for nursing homes and adult care increased by 2.4% in July from the previous month, the biggest gain on records dating back to 1997.It’s mind-boggling. An apartment in an assisted-living facility had an average rate of $73,000 a year as of the second quarter of 2023, according to the National Investment Center for Seniors Housing & Care —and costs go up as residents age and need more care. Units for dementia patients can run more than $90,000 annually.Big red warning flag: Johnson of the Senior Citizens League warns that you shouldn't expect your Social Security monthly check to cushion bills. Healthcare costs typically grow two to three times faster than overall inflation. "The rising cost of these drugs can be crippling because cost of living adjustments (COLAs) won’t come close to offsetting your prescription drug and other healthcare costs as you age," she said.Here's one reason why: The Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, used to calculate the annual increases, assumes that consumers spend 7% of their total budget on healthcare. In reality, older consumers tend to spend 16% or more of their household budgets on healthcare, said Johnson.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Ways to get relief: There are programs that help people with limited resources to pay for their premiums and cost-sharing. But many people who are eligible are not enrolled. To find out if you’re eligible, start by contacting your state’s Medicaid program or your State Health Insurance Assistance Program.If you still have years to retirement, you can contribute to a health savings account, or HSA. To be eligible, though, you must be enrolled in a high-deductible healthcare plan. The annual inflation-adjusted limit on HSA contributions for self-only coverage under a high-deductible health plan is $3,850. The HSA contribution limit for family coverage is $7,750.The beauty of it is that an HSA has a triple tax advantage for your retirement savings. It lets you put money in on a tax-free basis and allows it to build up tax-free, and spend it tax-free for qualified healthcare expenses.Word of warning: If you pull the funds from the HSA for something other than qualified medical expenses, your withdrawal will be subject to income tax, plus a 20% penalty.In other words: Don't try using the money for a vacation to St. Barths.Kerry Hannon is a Senior Reporter and Columnist at Yahoo Finance.

Text Content: By Elizabeth HowcroftLONDON (Reuters) - Payments giant PayPal will stop allowing UK customers to buy cryptocurrencies through its platform from October as it works to comply with new rules on crypto promotions.Britain's financial regulator is due to bring in tougher rules to limit how crypto is advertised to British consumers, including requiring crypto firms to carry warnings about the risk and scrapping "refer a friend" bonuses.PayPal will "temporarily pause" the ability for customers to buy crypto on its platform from Oct. 1 as it works to satisfy the new regulations, which come into effect on Oct. 8, it said in an email to customers on Tuesday. It said it expects to re-start in "early 2024"."PayPal consistently works closely with regulators around the world to adhere to applicable rules and regulations in the markets in which we operate," it told customers in the email, a copy of which it shared with Reuters.It said customers could hold and sell their crypto "at any time."The news was earlier reported by crypto media outlets including CoinJournal.PayPal first launched crypto buying and selling in the UK in 2021.Regulators around the world are increasingly seeking to regulate crypto assets, after the collapse of several crypto firms including FTX last year left amateur investors with large losses.After token prices slumped dramatically last year, the price of top cryptocurrency bitcoin has gradually recovered, up around 76% so far this year. Still, its price is at less than half of the all-time high reached in November 2021.Earlier this month, PayPal's shares got a boost when it announced that it has launched a U.S. dollar stablecoin - a kind of cryptocurrency designed to keep a constant price by being pegged to a stable asset.(Reporting by Elizabeth Howcroft; Editing by Bernadette Baum)

Text Content: When it comes to passenger safety in the popular midsize car segment, the Honda Accord rules supreme.In new crash data from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), only the Honda Accord earned the highest overall rating of “good” among six midsize sedans when it comes to rear-seat passengers’ safety.The IIHS said the Subaru Outback was next safest with an “acceptable” rating, followed by the Nissan Altima and Toyota Camry, which were rated as “marginal.” The Hyundai Sonata, Kia K5, and Volkswagen Jetta were all rated “poor.”“In most of the midsize cars we tested, the rear dummy slid forward, or ‘submarined,’ beneath the lap belt, causing it to ride up from the pelvis onto the abdomen and increasing the risk of internal injuries,” IIHS President David Harkey said in the report. “In the three poor-rated vehicles, measurements taken from the rear dummy also indicated likely injuries to the head or neck as well as to the chest.”IIHS crash test image of the Honda Accord (IIHS YouTube video)The new data from the IIHS comes as the safety organization launched a new crash examination called the “moderate overall front crash test.” That measures the impact when the front corners of two vehicles driving in opposite directions collide at 40 mph.The IIHS found that in those conditions in newer vehicles, the risk of a fatal injury is now higher for rear-seat passengers wearing seatbelts than for those in front. Furthermore the IIHS now uses a crash test dummy the size of a small woman or a 12-year-old child in the rear seats, which more accurately represents the average profile of passengers.The IIHS said in order to get a good rating, there can’t be an excessive risk of injury to the head, neck, chest, or thigh, as recorded by the second-row dummy, and it should be “correctly positioned” during the crash without submarining. In the Accord, IIHS data showed “no heightened risk of injuries, and the rear restraints did a good job controlling the dummy’s motion.”IIHS ratings for midsize cars using the updated moderate overlap front test (IIHS)In both the marginal-rated Altima and Camry, the IIHS noted that the rear dummy submarined beneath the lap belt, and the shoulder belt moved off the shoulder toward the dummy’s neck. In the poor-rated Sonata, K5, and Jetta, measurements taken from the rear dummy indicated likely injuries to the head or neck and chest — and excessive belt forces, IIHS said. In the K5 and Sonata, the rear shoulder belt also moved off the shoulder toward the neck.Story continuesThe Accord, which is all new for 2023, priced starting at just under $27,300, is slightly more expensive than all of its competitors except the Subaru Outback ($28,895), which is bigger and, in fact, almost like an SUV.The mid-size sedan market in the US and globally has been shrinking, as buyers favor crossovers like the Outback and other smaller SUVs. Last year global SUV sales climbed 2.3% to a record 32.8 million sold, notching a market share of 41.3% of all vehicles. In the US, SUV sales accounted for 54% of all light vehicles sold.Safety advocates also warn that the rising numbers of SUVs and crossovers, which generally have a bigger footprint and weigh more, are more dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists. Another study published in the Journal of Safety Research found that while SUVs and trucks accounted for just 26.1% of pedestrian and cyclist collisions, those collisions resulted in 44.1% of all fatalities.Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Text Content: By Abhirup RoySAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Texas on Wednesday approved its plan to require companies to include Tesla's technology in electric vehicle (EV) charging stations to be eligible for federal funds, despite calls for more time to re-engineer and test the connectors.The decision by Texas - the biggest recipient of a $5 billion program meant to electrify U.S. highways - is being closely watched by other states and is a step forward for Tesla CEO Elon Musk's plans to make its technology the U.S. charging standard.Federal rules require companies offer the rival Combined Charging System (CCS) - a U.S. standard that has been preferred by the Biden administration - as a minimum to be eligible for the funds.But individual states can add their own requirements on top of CCS before distributing the federal funds at a local level.Ford Motor and General Motors' announcement just over two months ago that they planned to adopt Tesla's North American Charging Standard (NACS) sent shockwaves through the industry and prompted a number of automakers and charging companies to embrace the technology.In June, Reuters reported that Texas - which will receive and deploy $407.8 million over five years - planned to mandate companies to include Tesla's plugs. Washington state has talked about similar plans and Kentucky has already mandated it.But some charging companies wrote to the Texas Transportation Commission, opposing the requirement in the first round of funds and citing concerns about the supply chain and certification of Tesla's connectors, saying it would put the successful deployment of EV chargers at risk.That forced Texas to defer a vote on the plan twice as it sought to understand NACS and its implications.But on Wednesday, the commission voted unanimously to approve the plan."The two-connector approach being proposed will help assure coverage of a minimum of 97% of the current, over 168,000 electric vehicles with fast charge ports in the state," Humberto Gonzalez, a director at Texas' department of transportation said while presenting the state's plan to the commissioners.(Reporting by Abhirup Roy in San Francisco; Editing by Kirsten Donovan)

Text Content: By Noel Randewich(Reuters) - The U.S. economy is likely growing at a 5.8% annualized rate in the third quarter, the Atlanta Federal Reserve’s GDPNow forecast model showed on Wednesday following the release of data on housing starts and industrial production.This was faster than the 5.0% pace estimated by the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow model on Tuesday.The regional Fed bank's GDPNow model typically diverges from reality early in any given quarter, and analysts say they expect the estimate to drop as more data comes in.But it is a signal that the economy, far from falling into recession, is coping with 5.25 percentage points of U.S. Federal Reserve rate hikes since March 2022.U.S. single-family homebuilding surged in July and permits for future construction rose amid an acute shortage of previously owned houses.Other data showed output at factories recovered 0.5% in July after declining 0.5% in June.Separately, Deutsche Bank increased its estimate for third quarter real gross domestic product, which takes inflation into account, to 3.1% from 1.5%.The latest indications of a resilient U.S. economy come as traders largely expect the Fed has completed its aggressive campaign of interest rate hikes.(Reporting by Noel Randewich; additional reporting by Ann Saphir; editing by Barbara Lewis)

Text Content: Stocks have been choppy in August, with the benchmark S&P 500( ^GSPC) lagging over the past month. But the same can't be said for the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI).The Dow tied its longest run of positive trading days ever in late July and has led gains across the three major averages over the past month."The first half of the year was all about tech, and it was all about the Magnificent Seven leading the way," Freedom Capital Markets Chief Global Strategist Jay Woods recently told Yahoo Finance. "Now we're seeing a healthy rotation."After tech and the AI narrative led stocks higher for the first six months of the year, things have shifted. AI isn't moving stocks in the same manner during second quarter earnings. Instead, it's industrials leading the way, and Woods says that's could be a bullish sign for markets overall."This is a theory that goes back to the early 1900s," Woods said. "And it basically says one thing, when the Dow Jones Industrials, the things that make, and the Dow Jones Transports, the things that take, are doing well. And in this case, both at 52-week highs...This is a bullish development, and it's something we have to watch."Woods recently highlighted the Dow's success to Jared Mitovich in Yahoo Finance's Chartbook, which contains 50 charts that tell the story of markets and the economy this year.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Visa Inc. is facing fresh scrutiny from the US Justice Department over how it charges merchants for technology it uses to protect cardholder information.As part of a long-running DOJ investigation, enforcement officials have begun probing the payment giant’s policies for charging retailers more if they don’t use Visa’s proprietary “tokenization” technology, according to people familiar with the matter.The service, which swaps sensitive card numbers with tokens that can only be used on a specific device or with a particular merchant, is designed to improve the security of any given payment.The inquiries come more than two years after the agency first informed Visa it was opening an antitrust probe into the company’s practices, and several months after rival Mastercard Inc. resolved a case involving its own tokenization practices. The Justice Department has issued a raft of civil investigative demands this year regarding potential violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act, the US’s primary law aimed at reining in monopolies.Spokespeople for Visa and the Justice Department declined to comment.Shares of the company, which are up 16% this year, were little changed at $240.32 at 9:44 a.m. in New York.Visa introduced tokenization in 2014. At its core, the service replaces the 16-digit account number with a token that only Visa can unlock, which protects cardholder information as it passes between retailers and banks.Since its debut, Visa has issued more than 4 billion tokens, and more than 13,000 merchants have adopted the technology, including Netflix Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.’s Fitbit.Story continuesVisa has for years offered merchants a lower price if they use the service. The payment giant has long sought to see more of its cardholders’ information tokenized because of the vastly improved security it brings to a payment.“In addition to enhancing security, tokenization can reduce friction in the payment process by enabling financial institutions to automatically update expired or compromised payment credentials without any manual updates made by the customer in the event that their Visa card is lost, stolen or expired,” Visa says on its website.Pricing TweaksIn recent weeks, as part of its normal schedule for adjusting fees, Visa and its partners informed merchants that it will tweak some of its rates in coming months, according to a document seen by Bloomberg News. The planned changes were partly what sparked the Justice Department’s renewed interest in the tokenization topic, according to the people, who asked not to be identified discussing non-public information.Included in the plan are new rates for tokenized payments versus non-tokenized payments. Take, for instance, merchants that impose recurring charges on consumers, such as streaming services and cable-television providers. Starting in April, the largest of those will pay $1.38 in card fees for every $100 in purchases they process on a traditional Visa card. But the price drops to $1.28 if they use the company’s tokenization technology, the document shows.It may be only pennies per transaction, but it adds up: Merchants last year spent a record $160.7 billion on these so-called swipe fees, up almost 17% from 2021, according to the Nilson Report. While Visa and Mastercard set the rates, it’s the banks that issue the cards that keep most of the money.Visa’s rivals have also attracted unwanted scrutiny regarding tokenization. In December, the Federal Trade Commission — which enforces antitrust and consumer protection laws — reached a settlement with Mastercard to resolve allegations the company was using its tokenization technology to block merchants from using alternate payment networks.The FTC is charged with enforcing the so-called Durbin Amendment, part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank law that requires banks to include two competing networks on their debit cards. The FTC alleged that Mastercard historically wouldn’t let alternative networks access its so-called token vault for certain e-commerce transactions, which meant merchants would have no choice but to route the transaction over Mastercard’s network to ensure the payment would be authorized. Under the settlement, which was finalized in May, Mastercard agreed to provide customers’ personal account numbers to those alternative networks.Visa, though, has for years had a policy to give alternative networks access to that information, according to a person familiar with the company’s practices.Debit CardsThe Justice Department’s Visa probe has focused on whether the San Francisco-based company has taken steps to monopolize the debit-card market in violation of antitrust law.But Visa was in the DOJ’s crosshairs even before that investigation was announced. In 2020, the company announced plans to buy the financial-technology provider Plaid Inc., but abandoned the deal a year later after the agency sued to block the acquisition. At the time, the Justice Department called Visa’s tokenization service a “technological barrier” that it argued Visa was using to limit competitors from offering a viable product for online debit-card transactions.Two months after it ditched the takeover, Visa disclosed that the department had informed the company of plans to open a separate investigation, and the agency soon after that issued a civil investigative demand that sought documents and information related to the company’s US debit practices and competition with other payment methods and networks.This year, the agency issued further civil investigative demands seeking additional information about those practices. Visa has said it’s been cooperating with the investigation.(Adds shares in sixth paragraph.)©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: Weight loss drugs are making Cardinal Health (CAH) take flight.The drug distributor reported fourth quarter results on Tuesday that topped expectations, posting both increased revenue and a rosier outlook for the year ahead thanks to its pharmaceuticals unit and its standout demand for GLP-1 drugs.In its fourth quarter, Cardinal Health's pharmaceuticals unit saw revenue rise 15% to $49.7 billion. And over the next fiscal year, the company expects revenues for this business to rise 10% to 12% above 2023, higher than the forecast for 10% revenue growth offered at its investor day in June.In an interview with Yahoo Finance, CEO Jason Hollar said of this category of drugs, "It is important to customers so it is important to us."On a call with analysts on Tuesday, CFO Aaron Alt said that, similar to the third quarter, "GLP-1 medications provided us revenue tailwind in the quarter." The company noted, however, that given these products are branded — rather than generics — they are not a meaningful contributor to profits.Compared to those larger increases in the revenue forecasts, Cardinal Health expects profits in its pharmaceuticals business to grow 4% to 6% in 2024, unchanged from its June forecast.The company reported total revenues in the fourth quarter of $53.5 billion with earnings per share coming in at $1.55, beating Wall Street forecasts for revenues of $52.7 billion and earnings per share of $1.48, according to estimates from S&P Capital IQ.Lisa Gill, an analyst at JPMorgan, called the quarter a "clean beat" for Cardinal Health.Cardinal Health stock initially popped on Tuesday but lost ground along with the broader market. The stock is up 18% year to date.The sharp demand in obesity drugs has caused shortagesGLP-1 drugs are a class of weight loss drugs named for the hormone they mimic in the body, which slows digestion.Demand for these drugs has boomed in the last year, making the drugs increasingly hard to come by.Story continuesNovo Nordisk (NVO) is facing shortages as demand continues to outpace production. The company's twin cash cows are its diabetes drug Ozempic and weight loss drug Wegovy, both GLP-1s.For Cardinal Health, demand for these drugs accelerated in the final two quarters of its fiscal 2023, though the company said demand may level out in the coming year."We saw a strong finish to the year as it relates to [GLP1 drugs]," Hollar told analysts on Tuesday. "And looking forward, we see that there's nothing that we can foresee in the near term that will change those trends.""Now of course, we don't know what that slope is going to look like into '24, but we would anticipate as you start to lap the second half of '23 that that will be more muted in terms of the year-over-year benefit," Hollar added.The Cardinal Health, Inc. corporate office in Dublin, Ohio.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- US factory production rose in July for the first time in three months, boosted by a surge in motor-vehicle output that helped manufacturing to stabilize.Output increased 0.5% from June, erasing the prior month’s decline, Federal Reserve data showed Wednesday. Total industrial production, which includes mining and utilities, jumped 1%, the most since the start of the year.Factory production was led by a 5.2% surge in motor-vehicle output. The annualized rate of car assemblies increased to 11.87 million units, the fastest rate since the end of 2018. The data showed that manufacturing output excluding motor vehicles rose just 0.1% after falling in the previous two months.Even with the monthly advance, the Fed’s index of factory output was down 0.7% from a year ago, with manufacturers still facing challenges of a struggling global economy.What Bloomberg Economics Says...“With downward revisions of past data accounting for the upward surprises in the July report, and with the headline being driven more so by weather than by demand for core goods, we continue to view the manufacturing landscape as softening as demand for core goods wanes.”— Stuart PaulTo read the full note, click hereWhile recent surveys of purchasing managers at manufacturers continue to show activity is shrinking, the pace of decline is no longer steepening.Production of business equipment rose by the most in three months, the Fed’s report showed.

Home Depot rose 1.2%.The S&P 500 consumer staples index added 0.4%, while energy firms rose 0.5% as Chevron gained 1.3% after Mizuho upgraded its rating.Equities have been going through a rough patch in August, with the S&P 500 languishing at a more than one-month low as data underscoring sticky inflation and a robust economy has fanned fears of interest rates staying elevated for longer.While investors largely expect the Fed's monetary tightening to be nearing its end, worries linger the central bank could hold rates at the current level for longer.Traders' bets of a rate hike pause in September stand at nearly 91%, according to CME Group's Fedwatch tool.The Federal Reserve's July 25-26 meeting minutes are due at 1400 ET (1800 GMT). The central bank had raised rates by 25 basis points at the end of the meeting."Investors are expecting that the Fed's tone will remain fairly hawkish within those minutes," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research."Our economists believe that rates will be cut in the beginning of 2024, but the worry is that maybe the Fed will keep rates higher for longer in order to ensure that inflation is coming down."Story continuesInvestors also digested stronger-than-expected industrial production data for July which drove yields on the 10-year Treasury note to session highs of 4.235%.Nvidia edged up 0.5% after Piper Sandler became the latest Wall Street brokerage to raise its price target on the stock ahead of the chip designer's earnings next week.Keeping the Nasdaq under pressure, Tesla slid 0.4% after the electric-car maker cut prices for its premium Model S and Model X cars in China by more than 6%.At 9:55 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 137.92 points, or 0.39%, at 35,084.31, the S&P 500 was up 5.03 points, or 0.11%, at 4,442.89, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 29.36 points, or 0.22%, at 13,601.68.Among other stocks, U.S.-listed shares of Tower Semiconductor dropped 8.8%, after Intel terminated its plans to acquire the Israeli contract chipmaker.Coinbase gained 2.5% as it secured regulatory approval to offer cryptocurrency futures to U.S. retail customers.Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.53-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.03-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.The S&P index recorded three new 52-week highs and 10 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 20 new highs and 92 new lows.(Reporting by Amruta Khandekar and Shristi Achar A in Bengaluru Editing by Maju Samuel and Vinay Dwivedi)

Text Content: Aug 16 (Reuters) - Russia's battered rouble was given a reprieve with this week's emergency 350-basis-point rate hike to 12% but further action is likely to be needed for a more lasting impact.The Russian currency has lost more than a fifth of its value since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 and tumbled past the symbolic threshold of 100 per dollar on Monday.The impact of sanctions in reduced export revenues and higher import costs has contributed to rouble weakening, as has Moscow's sharply increased spending on its military to prosecute its war in Ukraine.With accelerating inflation causing prices for basic goods to rise and a presidential election approaching in March 2024, the rouble's fate is a sensitive subject for Russian authorities.The surest way to stabilise the rouble would be for Russia to withdraw its troops from Ukraine and cut back on soaring military spending, but assuming Moscow does not take those steps, here are some things Russia may try:1. HIKE RATES AGAINOne available option would be to hike rates again. Last year's key rate increase to 20% calmed markets down and supported the rouble before capital controls started to take hold.But higher borrowing costs squeeze economic growth prospects and make life harder for companies and, in particular, the government as it finances military operations in Ukraine.The finance ministry has said that lower rates would ease pressure on the budget deficit and its financing needs.Furthermore, future hikes are unlikely to deter ongoing capital outflows, UBP said in a note."Higher interest rates will merely slow the pace of rouble depreciation."2. CAPITAL CONTROLSRussian authorities are discussing bringing back the compulsory sale of foreign currency revenues for exporters, five sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday, among other capital control measures that should buttress the rouble.One source said four measures were being considered:Story continues* Exporters returning up to 90% of export revenues to Russia.* Exporters who do not comply with this losing access to government support.* Bans on dividends and loans being paid abroad, including in jurisdictions that Russia considers "friendly".* Ban on import subsidies.Russia ordered exporters to convert 80% of FX revenues last year to support financial stability, which ultimately pushed the rouble to a more than seven-year high in June 2022.Sources said that if the rouble does not show signs of improving by Friday, capital controls could be reintroduced.3. REDUCE LIQUDITY SURPLUSThe remaining options may be too limited in scope to make a large difference, but the central bank does have other tools at its disposal.It could try to reduce the rouble liquidity surplus by raising banks' reserve requirements, thereby reducing the money supply that could be exchanged to foreign currency.The Bank of Russia has shown that it is not indifferent to rouble volatility and the prospect of new steps to curb devaluation will at least temporarily weaken foreign currency demand, said Promsvyazbank analysts.The central bank has already said it will stop holding one-year repo, or repurchase agreement, auctions that help banks manage their liquidity. Banks currently owe the central bank 1.28 trillion roubles ($13.46 billion) as a result of these auctions.Deputy Governor Alexei Zabotkin said the decision to stop repo auctions was not tied to the rouble's weakening and merely a coincidence.4. FX INTERVENTIONSOne way to defend the rouble is for Russia to sell foreign currency from its National Wealth Fund (NWF). After a months-long hiatus, Russia resumed FX interventions in January, selling China's yuan.Russia tried to switch to FX purchases in August, but that was swiftly aborted, with Russia effectively abandoning its own budget rule as the rouble fell.However, selling large amounts of foreign currency would deplete Moscow's FX reserves. Sanctions have frozen around half of Moscow's pre-war pile of more than $600 billion in FX.Zabotkin last week said that the bank would take that step as and when it was deemed necessary.5. INCREASE OIL EXPORTSAnalysts from Alfa Bank on Tuesday said Russia's decision to limit oil exports to support global prices is the structural reason behind the weak rouble.Moscow is extending an oil export cut into September, with next month's oil exports to be slashed by 300,000 barrels per day.Russia's oil and gas exports are down sharply this year, primarily due to a Western oil price cap and embargo. Other markets have opened up for Russia, but Moscow is forced to sell at a discount.Any increase in supply would see global prices fall.6. CREATIVE TAXESA more outlandish option could be to impose new taxes on foreign currency transactions, as proposed on Tuesday by a lawmaker in the lower house of parliament, the State Duma.Duma lawmaker Vladimir Koshelev proposed taxing FX transactions on the stock market and tightening the regulation of profits in foreign currency.The Interfax news agency quoted a source as saying that authorities had discussed a new excess profit tax for those exporters that refuse to cooperate with returning revenues.

Source: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/treasuries-yields-dip-fed-meeting-142855227.html
Text Content: By Karen Brettell NEW YORK, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Most U.S. Treasury yields were lower on Wednesday as investors waited on minutes from the Federal Reserve’s July meeting for further clues on whether the U.S. central bank is likely to continue hiking rates. Yields rose earlier as U.S. data beat economists' expectations. U.S. single-family homebuilding surged in July amid an acute shortage of previously owned houses. U.S. July industrial output, meanwhile, rose by 1.0%, beating expectations for a 0.3% gain. But further yield increases may depend on whether investors believe the U.S. central bank could keep raising rates. Benchmark 10-year yields are holding below a 10-month high reached on Tuesday after data showed that retail sales rose more than expected in July. Ben Jeffery, an interest rate strategist at BMO Capital Markets, noted that Tuesday's selloff reached levels that were attractive to buyers and several factors might support lower yields. “We have gotten still good but no longer accelerating NFP (nonfarm payroll) prints, (and) a couple of CPI prints that show disinflation is continuing," Jeffery said. "I would say the consensus at this point is that the Fed will not hike in September even if they may hike in November/December, and I think all of these things are probably translating into increased comfort in buying dips.” Concerns about the Chinese economy are also adding to fears of a global slowdown. Missed payments on investment products by a leading Chinese trust firm and a fall in home prices have added to worries that China's deepening property sector crisis is stifling what little momentum the economy has left. In the longer-term, however, analysts note that increasing Treasury supply due to a deteriorating U.S. deficit and the potential for lower demand from Japanese investors as the Bank of Japan shifts away from its ultra loose monetary policy could keep U.S. Treasury yields higher than they would otherwise be. Benchmark 10-year yields were last at 4.205%, after reaching 4.274% on Tuesday. A break above the 4.338% level reached in October would bring yields to their highest since 2007. Interest rate sensitive two-year yields were at 4.925%. They are holding below yields of 5.120% reached on July 6, which were the highest since June 2007. The inversion in the yield curve between two-year and 10-year notes narrowed to minus 72 basis points. Fed meeting minutes due later on Wednesday will be evaluated for any clues on whether further rate hikes are on the table. “We’re going to be looking at any emphasis on either the lagged impact of monetary policy or persistent concerns about credit implications from the regional banking crisis,” said Jeffery. The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyo., between Aug. 24 and Aug. 26 could also deliver clarity on Fed thinking. The Fed’s Sept. 19-20 meeting will also give new interest rate clues as Fed officials will update their interest rate projections for the coming quarters.

Text Content: By Davide BarbusciaNEW YORK (Reuters) -Deflationary pressures in China could spill over into global markets, which is potentially near-term good news for Western central banks as they seek to curb inflation, U.S. asset manager PIMCO said on Wednesday.China's consumer sector fell into deflation and factory-gate prices extended declines in July, as the world's second-largest economy struggled to revive demand and a flurry of policies to support the economy failed to shore up activity.The economic deterioration could moderate inflation in China and, increasingly, also in the markets served by Chinese goods, PIMCO Economist and Managing Director Tiffany Wilding said in a note."Persistent deflation in China would likely spill over to developed markets, as a weaker yuan and an elevated inventory-to-sales ratios lower the cost of Chinese goods abroad – a development central bankers in developed markets would likely welcome," she said.“Given the usual lags, deflationary spillovers have likely only just begun to impact global consumer markets, with discounting likely to accelerate over the coming quarters.”The Chinese central bank cut key policy rates on Tuesday for the second time in three months to boost the economy, but investors have so far been unimpressed.Oxford Economics said in a note on Wednesday that it had reduced its 2023 gross domestic product growth forecast for China to a below-consensus 5.1%."Deflation, weakening trade, collapsing loan demand, and a paralysed property sector dampen our risk appetite," it said.On Wednesday, data showed China's new home prices fell for the first time this year in July, as policy support failed to shore up the embattled property sector.Meanwhile, a senior official told investors that Zhongrong International Trust Co., a leading Chinese trust firm, had missed repayments on dozens of investment products since late last month, adding to fears the country's property crisis would have a wider impact in the financial sector.Story continues"For China, the risk of more pronounced deflationary pressure depends crucially on the government’s policies in the coming months," said Wilding."Adequate fiscal stimulus to boost domestic demand may reaccelerate inflation, while delayed or inadequate policy measures could lead to a downward spiral," she said.(Reporting by Davide BarbusciaEditing by Mark Potter)

Source: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jersey-oks-slightly-better-settlement-180551711.html
Text Content: TOMS RIVER, N.J. (AP) — New Jersey has accepted a revised settlement over chemical dumping that turned parts of a Jersey Shore community into one of America's most notorious toxic waste cleanup sites, but opponents say the deal is only marginally better than before and plan to sue the state to block it.The deal adds slightly more protected land and financial compensation for the public over damage to natural resources in and around Toms River, a community that saw its rate of childhood cancer cases increase. The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection said Wednesday it finalized the settlement with the German chemical company BASF for decades of dumping by BASF's corporate predecessor, Ciba-Geigy Chemical Corp.However, a group representing residents and environmentalists says the new deal is “vastly inadequate, by several orders of magnitude.”The revised final settlement with BASF increases a cash payment from the company from $100,000 to $500,000, adds another 50 acres of company-controlled land to a conservation and public access plan, and obligates BASF to maintain nine restoration projects outlined in the original agreement for 20 years, up from 10 years in the original deal. The company must also restore wetlands and grassy areas; create walking trails, boardwalks and an elevated viewing platform; and build an environmental education center.The DEP said the settlement is designed to preserve approximately 1,000 acres of the former industrial site onto which Ciba-Geigy dumped toxic chemicals from dye-making and other operations. It is designed to protect groundwater in perpetuity, and compensate the public for the damage to that resource.Ciba-Geigy Chemical Corp., which had been the town’s largest employer, flushed chemicals into the Toms River and the Atlantic Ocean, and buried 47,000 drums of toxic waste in the ground. This created a plume of polluted water that has spread beyond the site into residential neighborhoods. It made the area one of America’s most prominent Superfund sites, joining the list of the most seriously polluted areas in need of federally supervised cleanup.Story continuesThe state health department found that 87 children in Toms River, which was then known as Dover Township, had been diagnosed with cancer from 1979 through 1995. A study determined the rates of childhood cancers and leukemia in girls in Toms River “were significantly elevated when compared to state rates.” No similar rates were found for boys.Residents and environmental groups quickly dismissed the revised deal as not much better than the original one, which they also decried as woefully inadequate.“Really, nothing has changed, other than now we're going to court,” said Britta Forsberg, executive director of the environmental group Save Barnegat Bay. They're one of many groups pushing the state to insist on significantly better compensation given the historic harm that occurred at the site and in neighboring communities.“They never put a value to the damage caused to our land, our river, our bay, our ocean, our wildlife or our habitat,” Forsberg said.Ciba-Geigy, which was charged criminally, has paid millions of dollars in fines and penalties on top of the $300 million it and its successors have paid so far to clean up the 1,250-acre (506-hectare) site — an ongoing effort with no end in sight. BASF, the successor company to Ciba-Geigy, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the revised deal.DEP Commissioner Shawn LaTourette has said the settlement is not designed to punish anyone, and emphasized that BASF remains obligated to completely finish cleaning up the site under the supervision of the federal Environmental Protection Agency.In 1992, Ciba-Geigy paid $63.8 million to settle criminal charges that it illegally disposed of hazardous waste, and it and two other companies reached a $13.2 million settlement with 69 families whose children were diagnosed with cancer.BASF took over the site in 2010, two decades after plant operations ceased, and emphasizes that it did nothing to contaminate the site.The company is pumping almost a million gallons a day from the ground, treating it to remove contaminants, and discharging it back into the ground. About 341,000 cubic yards (261,000 cubic meters) of soil has been dug up and treated at the site — enough to fill 136,400 pickup truck beds.___Follow Wayne Parry at www.twitter.com/WayneParryAC

Text Content: (Bloomberg) — While many of the largest tech companies are joining a US corporate effort to compel employees back to the office, Atlassian Inc. is among the firms remaining steadfast backers of remote work.Atlassian has committed to a workplace model without mandatory office attendance, Annie Dean, the company’s vice president of “team anywhere,” said in an interview. With more than 11,000 employees, Atlassian is “the largest company in the world committed to distributed work at this scale,” she said.Remote collaboration with periodic in-person gatherings boosts productivity and allows the Australian-founded software company to recruit better talent, Dean said. More than half of the people hired during the last year live over two hours from an office, she said.Also holding out against the return-to-office movement is Airbnb Inc., which has said its roughly 6,000 employees can work from anywhere with regular meet-ups structured around product releases. Software company Twilio Inc. has no office-return rules for its 6,400 employees — about 60% of its workforce is in locations where the firm historically hasn’t had offices, Chief Executive Officer Jeff Lawson said in a March interview. Autodesk Inc., Dropbox Inc., Okta Inc. and Gitlab Inc. are other tech employers without mandatory office attendance.“At a time when many companies are requiring employees to return to the office a certain number of days per week, Autodesk will stay the course and has no plans for corporate return-to-office mandates for hybrid and remote-based employees, Rebecca Pearce, chief people officer at Autodesk,” which had 13,7000 employees as of January, wrote in a blog post.Story continuesBefore Atlassian, Dean led Meta Platforms Inc.’s remote work initiative. With a three-day-a-week office mandate beginning in September, the social media giant has joined the list of major employers pushing a return to the office. Amazon.com Inc. will require some corporate workers to relocate to meet new office rules. International Business Machines Corp.’s Arvind Krishna said in May that promotions will be rarer for those who aren’t on site. Beyond tech, companies from Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. to BlackRock Inc. have bumped expected in-office time to four days a week.Read More: Citigroup, Google Among Firms Tightening Return-to-Office RulesAnd plenty of firms have backpedaled from their previous positions. Zoom Video Communications Inc. said early last year that most employees would be able to choose whether to work on site or not. Earlier this month, it mandated at least two days a week in the office. Salesforce Inc. Chief Executive Officer Marc Benioff, an early public advocate of remote work, has touted the importance of collaborating in person, with some salespeople called back to company offices.These new high-profile mandates aren’t showing up in return-to-office data. Attendance was at less than half of pre-Covid levels across 10 of the largest US business districts last week, according to data from Kastle Systems. That figure is roughly unchanged compared with the start of 2023. The San Jose, California area — home to many technology companies — recorded the lowest office attendance in that period at 37.5% of pre-pandemic levels.Atlassian’s Dean said she doesn’t anticipate that companies will uniformly march toward more restrictive office policies, adding that “a lot of these decisions are not well-grounded in data.” Real productivity problems include “back-to-back meetings, having minimal clarity about what goals you’re trying to move forward, overflowing inboxes, vague processes,” none of which are fixed by simply returning to the office, she said.—With assistance from Natalie Lung and Matthew Boyle.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Source: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/brazil-cap-carbon-emissions-large-174416009.html
Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Brazil will create a cap on carbon dioxide emissions for large polluting companies as part of a broader green transition initiative meant to help the country reach CO2 neutrality by 2050, according to one of the plan’s architects.President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva’s plan will include the creation of a regulated carbon market, as well as measures to gradually end subsidies for fossil fuels and stimulate the use of electric public transportation vehicles, said Rafael Dubeux, who is coordinating the program as a special adviser to Finance Minister Fernando Haddad.“These are very deep changes that will involve all sectors of the economy,” Dubeux said during a Tuesday interview in Brasilia, the capital. “The plan means more jobs, higher GDP and income for Brazilians.”The regulated carbon market will affect around 5,000 companies that annually emit more than 25,000 tons of CO2 equivalent into the atmosphere. Sectors like steel and cement, the chemical industry and aluminum manufacturers are likely to face the most immediate effects.The government has not yet determined a level for the cap. But it plans to gradually lower it each year until emissions are neutralized, Dubeux said.“This encourages companies to invest in decarbonization and innovation,” Dubeux said. “And there will be strong market surveillance. We are very concerned with ensuring that the Brazilian carbon credit has a lot of international credibility.”‘Ecological Transformation’The measures are the start of an “ecological transformation” of Latin America’s largest economy, Haddad said last week, that will seek to deliver on Lula’s campaign promises to simultaneously boost growth and an enact aggressive environmental agenda.Story continuesBrazil has long been at the center of global climate change discussions. It is home to the majority of the Amazon Rainforest and boasts one of the world’s cleanest energy mixes based on hydroelectricity and renewable fuels for transportation.But its overall emissions have bucked global trends and risen in recent years, its oil output is growing, and pollution from agricultural and industrial production has increased. Brazil has also been slow to join an international push toward electric vehicles, and is only now about to jump into booming sustainable bond markets for the first time.Read More: Lula Launches Green Transition With $350 Billion Investment PlanThe new initiatives will follow the broad contours of policies enacted by developed economies like the European Union, which leans on a cap-and-trade system as its key tool for cutting pollution and imposes decreasing emissions caps on thousands of facilities owned by utilities, manufacturers and airlines.Lula’s government expects to send legislation to create the carbon credit market to congress, where it may face resistance from conservative lawmakers, in the coming days. Other aspects of the plan, which according to Dubeux will also include concessions, credits and tax exemptions to promote decarbonization, could come through presidential decrees or other measures.The government is still calculating the impact a regulated carbon market would have, but Dubeux pointed to a study from Brazil’s National Industry Confederation that estimated it would boost gross domestic product by 2 percentage points and provide a 20% bump to the incomes of the country’s poorest people in the coming years.The proposals come alongside a $350 billion infrastructure investment program Lula unveiled last Friday that will include financing for energy transition projects and other green initiatives, the president and his economic team said at an event to launch the plan.While many of its investments will be sustainable, the so-called Growth Acceleration Plan, or PAC, also includes funding for more controversial initiatives, including the Ferrograo railway — a project to transport grain through part of the Amazon region that was suspended over environmental concerns. Brazil’s Supreme Court earlier this year allowed technical studies of the project to resume.Read More: Brazil Moves to Allow Amazon Oil Drilling, Marring Lula’s SummitThe plans reflect Lula’s efforts to balance immediate economic needs with his promises to transition it toward a more sustainable future, according to Dubeux.“Brazil is a lower-middle-income country in international comparison, and an ecological transformation plan cannot stop everything to start from scratch,” Dubeux said. “It is a process of change that we want to happen as quickly as possible.”(Updates with additional context from seventh paragraph)©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: LONDON (AP) — The British Museum said Wednesday that a member of its staff has been dismissed after items dating back as far as the 15th century B.C. were found to be missing, stolen or damaged.The museum said it has also ordered an independent review of security and a ‘‘vigorous program to recover the missing items.″The stolen artifacts include gold jewelry and gems of semi-precious stones and glass dating from the 15th century B.C. to the 19th century A.D. Most were small items kept in a storeroom and none had been on display recently, the museum said.“Our priority is now threefold: first, to recover the stolen items; second, to find out what, if anything, could have been done to stop this; and third, to do whatever it takes, with investment in security and collection records, to make sure this doesn’t happen again,″ said George Osborne, the museum’s chair.“This incident only reinforces the case for the reimagination of the museum we have embarked upon," Osborne said.The museum said legal action would be taken against the dismissed staff member and that the matter was under investigation by London’s Metropolitan Police Service.The 264-year-old British Museum is a major London tourist attraction, drawing visitors from around the world who come to see a vast collection of artifacts ranging from the Rosetta Stone that unlocked the language of ancient Egypt to scrolls bearing 12th century Chinese poetry and masks created by the indigenous people of Canada.But the museum has also attracted controversy because it has resisted calls from communities around the world to return items of historical significance that were acquired during the era of the British Empire. The most famous of these disputes include marble carvings from the Parthenon in Greece and the Benin bronzes from west Africa.Hartwig Fischer, the director of the British Museum, apologized and said the institution was determined to put things right.“This is a highly unusual incident,'' said Fischer said. “I know I speak for all colleagues when I say that we take the safeguarding of all the items in our care extremely seriously.''

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Intel Corp. walked away from its attempt to acquire Tower Semiconductor Ltd., abandoning a $5.4 billion deal after failing to win Chinese regulatory approval in time.Intel mutually agreed with Tower to terminate the February 2022 agreement, it said in a statement Wednesday. The Israeli firm confirmed the deal was scrapped. The two companies were expected to call off the deal after failing to get Chinese approval, Bloomberg News reported earlier.Tower shares fell as much as 12% in Tel Aviv, the biggest intraday decline since 2020. Tower’s US-traded shares were down 8.5% in New York Wednesday morning. Intel shares fell 1%.The purchase of the Israeli company was the keystone of Intel Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger’s plan to get into a faster-growing part of the semiconductor industry, the foundry market dominated by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Tower has a relatively small presence in that area — where companies make chips for clients on a contract basis — but has expertise and customers that Intel lacks.Rising tensions between China and the US have made securing approval for transactions that require the signoff from regulators in Beijing and Washington increasingly difficult, particularly those involving semiconductors, a key area of friction in the relationship.China reviews mergers involving foreign companies with a major presence in the country, and it isn’t unusual for the process to drag on.Last year, DuPont de Nemours Inc. scuttled a proposed $5.2 billion acquisition of Rogers Corp. after failing to get timely clearance from Beijing. In 2018, US-based Qualcomm Inc. scrapped a $44 billion bid for Dutch chipmaker NXP Semiconductors NV after a drawn-out review by the State Administration for Market Regulation.Story continuesRead More: DuPont-Rogers Failure Puts Eye on Deals Needing China NodOther deals that are subject to China antitrust review include Emerson Electric Co.’s takeover of National Instruments Corp, and Broadcom Inc.’s acquisition of VMWare Inc. But these don’t involve traditional semiconductors.Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said the deal’s failure wouldn’t be a huge surprise given the slide in Tower’s share price, but it would be a setback for Intel.“A failed deal does seem modestly disappointing for the prospects of Intel’s foundry efforts,” he wrote in a research note after Bloomberg’s story. “Overall Intel’s foundry efforts were never going to be easy even with Tower, but now may prove to be even more challenging without.”When the transaction was announced, Intel said it would take “about 12 months.” As of October, the chipmaker said it was targeting the first quarter 2023, but then in March warned that the date might slip into the second quarter.The deadline for completing the transaction was Aug. 15 at midnight in California. Intel will pay Tower a termination fee of $353 million.Read More: Intel to Buy Israel’s Tower Semiconductor for $5.4 BillionWhile Tower is a fraction of the size of Intel and TSMC in terms of revenue, it’s active in older types of production-making chips for big customers such as Broadcom Inc. Intel’s plan was to combine plants in its network as they age with Tower’s customer list. Though they don’t require the state-of-the-art production techniques that an Intel or Nvidia Corp. processor demands, many new types of chips for markets like electric vehicles can be made in these older plants.Investors had already discounted the chances of the deal being completed. US-traded stock of Tower has declined 22% this year, compared with the general advance in chip stocks. It closed Tuesday at $33.78.

Text Content: NEW YORK (AP) — The Teamsters flexed their muscles during contract negotiations with UPS last month, securing pay hikes for drivers and scoring other wins.But at Amazon, the picture looks much different.Since late June, dozens of Amazon drivers and dispatchers who work for a California-based delivery firm that the Teamsters unionized in April have been picketing company warehouses as far out as Michigan and Massachusetts, calling on the e-commerce behemoth to come to the table and bargain over pay and working conditions.Amazon has essentially said no. Teamsters say the strike will continue until Amazon reinstates the employees and comes to the bargaining table.Though small, the dispute in California signals what’s poised to be the next battlefront in Amazon’s efforts to fend off organized labor and the Teamsters’ years-long aim to take on one of their most formidable opponents.During speeches and interviews in recent months, Teamsters General President Sean O’Brien has aired his belief that a strong UPS contract would also bolster the union’s organizing prospects at Amazon, where the sole labor group — made up of current and former warehouse workers who won a union election last year — is still without a contract amid objections and appeals from the company.“Workers at Amazon are paying attention to the workers at UPS right now,” said Randy Korgan, who was appointed by O’Brien last year to lead the union’s recently launched Amazon division. “These are similar workers that look just like them — doing very similar work to what they’re doing.”The set-up at Amazon, however, is much different. Though the delivery drivers are clothed in the ubiquitous gray-blue Amazon vests and drive similarly colored vans, they’re not directly employed by the company. Instead, they work for the more than 3,000 delivery service partners, or DSPs, that Amazon has recruited to drop off packages to customers.Amazon’s business model originally relied heavily on other carriers, including UPS and the U.S. Postal Service where unions had major sway on pay and working conditions. But in the past few years, it has been reducing its dependence on other shippers and expanding its own logistics capability.Story continuesMost Amazon shipments these days go through the company’s own last-mile network, the final leg of a delivery that relies on DSPs that handle more than 10 million Amazon packages everyday. Outsourcing the work allows Amazon to eschew financial and legal liability that might come from directly employing hundreds of thousands of drivers. It also gives the retailer more cover from unionization attempts since the workers aren’t classified as Amazon employees under existing labor law.The Teamsters are seeking to challenge that in California. In a complaint filed in May with the National Labor Relations Board, the union argued Amazon should be considered a single or joint employer with Battle Tested Strategies, a DSP that employs more than 80 delivery drivers and dispatchers. The Teamsters maintain that Battle Tested Strategies belongs to a system that’s “owned and controlled” by Amazon.Amazon claims the union is spreading a false narrative about how its business works. The company also said that it terminated Battle Tested Strategies even before its workers unionized, accusing it of six breaches of contract, including failing to pay for insurance. Battle Tested Strategies — one of many DSPs that operate in California — stopped delivering for Amazon in late June.Johnathon Ervin, an Air Force veteran who owns Battle Tested Strategies, said he applied for Amazon’s delivery program in 2018 and launched his business the next year after months of training. Initially, he got five vans from the company and began deliveries in El Monte, a city in Los Angeles roughly 60 miles south of Palmdale, where the firm is located.Ervin said it was exciting at first, but it soon became challenging as his business grew and costs crept up for vehicle maintenance, insurance and other things like overtime pay during peak seasons. Amazon gives delivery firms a pot of money to cover expenses for every route they’re given, but he said it didn’t cover everything, like all overtime expenses for workers.Figuring out how to be profitable also became a headache. The company installs devices in vans that monitor drivers’ habits, and issues a weekly scorecard rating their performance on things like delivery completion from a scale from poor to “fantastic plus.” Those ratings determine how much DSPs make per package, but Ervin said the way Amazon assess drivers and the way delivery firms do might not always line up.“It’s a really insidiously data driven-control that they use to manipulate and move folks in the direction that they want them to go,” he said.Amazon spokesperson Mary Kate Paradis countered DSP rates vary by location across the country and the vast majority or those surveyed “say they’re within or above the projected profitability range of $75,000 and $300,000 per year.” In response to Ervin’s claims about failing to pay for overtime expenses, Paradis said DSPs are responsible for paying their employees.The Teamsters seem to be taking a long-term approach to organizing at Amazon. In the past few years, the union has been pushing back on Amazon projects in local communities and questioning the company’s federal contracts, among other things.John Logan, director of labor and employment studies at San Francisco State University, said focusing on subcontractors is also a good starting point for the Teamsters because its easier to organize those firms compared to larger Amazon warehouses.But he also noted the union’s campaign still seems somewhat underdeveloped because it's been focused on getting a good contract at UPS. The Teamsters' only other Amazon union victory was short-lived: In 2017, delivery drivers in Michigan who worked at a company that contracts with Amazon voted to organize. But Amazon dissolved their contract shortly thereafter.“Amongst other groups and younger people in the labor movement... they are very enthusiastic about the idea about not only organizing Amazon, but that there’s a very powerful union that’s prepared to put resources into that,” Logan said. “But it hasn’t happened yet. So we don’t really know.”

Text Content: (Adds details and background)By Abhirup RoySAN FRANCISCO, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Texas on Wednesday approved its plan to require companies to include Tesla's technology in electric vehicle (EV) charging stations to be eligible for federal funds, despite calls for more time to re-engineer and test the connectors.The decision by Texas - the biggest recipient of a $5 billion program meant to electrify U.S. highways - is being closely watched by other states and is a step forward for Tesla CEO Elon Musk's plans to make its technology the U.S. charging standard.Federal rules require companies offer the rival Combined Charging System (CCS) - a U.S. standard that has been preferred by the Biden administration - as a minimum to be eligible for the funds.But individual states can add their own requirements on top of CCS before distributing the federal funds at a local level.Ford Motor and General Motors' announcement just over two months ago that they planned to adopt Tesla's North American Charging Standard (NACS) sent shockwaves through the industry and prompted a number of automakers and charging companies to embrace the technology.In June, Reuters reported that Texas - which will receive and deploy $407.8 million over five years - planned to mandate companies to include Tesla's plugs. Washington state has talked about similar plans and Kentucky has already mandated it.But some charging companies wrote to the Texas Transportation Commission, opposing the requirement in the first round of funds and citing concerns about the supply chain and certification of Tesla's connectors, saying it would put the successful deployment of EV chargers at risk.That forced Texas to defer a vote on the plan twice as it sought to understand NACS and its implications.But on Wednesday, the commission voted unanimously to approve the plan."The two-connector approach being proposed will help assure coverage of a minimum of 97% of the current, over 168,000 electric vehicles with fast charge ports in the state," Humberto Gonzalez, a director at Texas' department of transportation said while presenting the state's plan to the commissioners.(Reporting by Abhirup Roy in San Francisco; Editing by Kirsten Donovan)

Text Content: (Adds rival drug in paragraph 5 and background throughout)Aug 16 (Reuters) -Seagen said on Wednesday that a combination of its therapy, Tukysa, met the main goal of a late-stage study in some breast cancer patients, boosting the prospects of the company that is in the process of being acquired by Pfizer Inc.Pfizer in March agreed to acquire Seagen and its targeted therapies in a$43 billiondeal to help the drugmaker brace for a steep fall in COVID-19 product sales and generic competition for some top-selling drugs.Tuksya, along with Roche's Kadcyla, helped extend the time that patients with a type of breast cancer lived without their disease worsening.Kadcyla belongs to a class of drugs called antibody-drug conjugates (ADC), which have been described as "guided-missile" cancer drugs and the use of these drugs for breast cancer patients has grown in the past few years.The Roche drug faces competition from Daiichi Sankyo’s and AstraZeneca's Enhertu.Tukysa, chemically known as tucatinib, is already approved in combination with Roche’s Herceptin and chemotherapy Xeloda in patients whose cancer has worsened or spread despite at least one prior round of treatment.In the current trial, the drug was being tested in patients with a type of breast cancer known as HER2 positive, which accounts for 15% to 20% of all breast cancers in the United States.HER2 protein contributes to the growth and spread of breast cancer.Breast cancer is the second-most common cancer among women in the United States, according to government data.

Home Depot climbed 1.3% in a big boost to the industrials-heavy Dow.Shares of TJX Companies rose 4.6% after the off-price retailer raised its fiscal 2024 outlook.The S&P 500 consumer staples index added 0.5%.Energy shares led sectoral gains, rising 0.6% as Chevron advanced 1.3% after Mizuho upgraded its rating.Equities have been going through a rough patch in August, with the S&P 500 languishing near one-month lows as data underscoring sticky inflation and a robust economy has fanned fears of interest rates staying elevated for longer.While investors largely expect the Fed's monetary tightening to be nearing its end, worries linger the central bank could hold rates at the current level for longer.Traders' bets of a rate hike pause in September stand at nearly 89%, according to CME Group's Fedwatch tool."Our economists believe that rates will be cut in the beginning of 2024, but the worry is that maybe the Fed will keep rates higher for longer in order to ensure that inflation is coming down," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.The Federal Reserve's July 25-26 meeting minutes are due at 1400 ET (1800 GMT). The central bank had raised rates by 25 basis points at the end of the meeting.Story continues"The Fed is almost finished — that is what the market is desperate for. There is a push pull between the hawks and the doves," said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial.Also helping equities, the yield on 10-year Treasury notes eased from a session high of 4.235% following stronger-than-expected industrial production data for July.Nvidia edged up 0.5%, gaining for a third session in a row after two more brokerages raised their price targets on the stock ahead of the chip designer's quarterly results next week.Keeping the Nasdaq under pressure, Tesla slid 1.8% after the electric-car maker cut prices for its premium Model S and Model X cars in China by more than 6%.At 11:36 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 100.60 points, or 0.29%, at 35,046.99, the S&P 500 was up 4.54 points, or 0.10%, at 4,442.40, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 33.35 points, or 0.24%, at 13,597.70.Among other stocks, U.S.-listed shares of Tower Semiconductor dropped 8.5%, after Intel terminated its plans to acquire the Israeli contract chipmaker.Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.09-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.44-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.The S&P index recorded four new 52-week highs and 13 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 27 new highs and 169 new lows.(Reporting by Amruta Khandekar and Shristi Achar A in Bengaluru Editing by Maju Samuel and Vinay Dwivedi)

Text Content: (Adds manufacturing data, analyst comments throughout)*Single-family housing starts increase 6.7% in July*Single-family building permits rise 0.6%*Overall housing starts climb 3.9%; permits gain 0.1%*Manufacturing production increases 0.5%By Lucia MutikaniWASHINGTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - U.S. single-family homebuilding surged in July and permits for future construction rose amid an acute shortage of previously owned houses, but mortgage rates climbing back to near two-decade highs could slow the housing market improvement.The sharp rebound in groundbreaking on single-family housing units reported by the Commerce Department on Wednesday was another sign of the economy continuing to defy dire forecasts of a recession. It followed news on Tuesday that retail sales rose strongly in July, which prompted economists to upgrade their growth estimates for the third quarters.With inflation retreating, economists did not see the flow of upbeat data leading to another interest rate hike next month."Housing generally has shown resilience, but Fed officials may overlook this latest news of strengthening demand in the economy when it comes to judging whether to hike rates again this year because of the progress made on the inflation front," said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York.Single-family housing starts, which account for the bulk of homebuilding, jumped 6.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 983,000 units last month. They rose 9.5% year-on-year in July. The increase in groundbreaking was led by the West, where single-family starts soared 28.5%.Starts rose 12.5% in the Midwest. But they fell 3.4% in the Northeast and declined 1.3% in the densely populated South.After being pummeled by the Federal Reserve's aggressive monetary policy tightening, the housing market has stabilized. Further improvement, however, looks likely to be curtailed by the renewed increase in mortgage rates.The average rate on the popular 30-year fixed mortgage has risen to 6.96% over the past weeks, according to latest data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac. The rate is within striking distance of the 7.08% seen in late October and early November, which was the highest since April 2002.Story continuesMortgage rates near 7% were attributed to the ebb in confidence among homebuilders in August, with the National Association of Home Builders saying more builders were offering incentives to attract buyers amid expectations of lower sales.The Fed has since March 2022 raised its benchmark overnight interest rate by 525 basis points to the current 5.25% to 5.50% range. Starts for housing projects with five units or more were unchanged at a rate of 460,000 units in July. Demand for rental accommodation, largely driven by higher mortgage rates sidelining some potential home buyers, is slowing. There is also a record stock of multi-family housing under construction.Overall housing starts increased 3.9% to a rate of 1.452 million units in July. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast starts rising to a rate of 1.448 million units."The need for new single-family homes, which is driven by scarce existing home inventory, should keep a floor under single-family construction," said Nancy Vanden Houten, U.S. lead economist at Oxford Economics in New York. "Homebuilders increased their use of incentives again in August, which may support sales and prevent a steep fall in single-family starts."Permits for future construction of single-family homes rose 0.6% in July to a rate of 930,000 units. They have now increased for six straight months and were lifted by rises in the Midwest and South. Single-family building permits, however, tumbled in the Northeast and were unchanged in the West.Permits for housing projects with five units or more fell 0.2% to a rate of 464,000 units, the lowest level since October 2020. Overall building permits edged up 0.1% to a rate of 1.442 million units last month.Stocks on Wall Street were higher. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.TIGHT SUPPLYDespite the rise in starts, housing supply is likely to remain tight. The number of houses approved for construction that are yet to be started fell 0.4% to 277,000 units in July.The single-family homebuilding backlog dropped 0.7% to 140,000 units, while the completions rate for this segment increased 1.3% a rate of 1.018 million units. Overall housing completions dropped 11.8% to a rate of 1.321 million units.The inventory of single-family housing under construction fell 0.7% to a rate of 678,000 units.The stock of multi-family housing under construction increased 1.1% to 986,000 units, the highest level since the government started tracking the series in 1970.Realtors estimate that housing starts and completion rates need to be in a range of 1.5 million to 1.6 million units per month to plug the inventory gap.There was encouraging news on the industrial side of the economy, which has been bruised by the U.S. central bank's rate hikes. Output at factories rebounded 0.5% in July after declining 0.5% in June, the Fed said in a separate report.The rebound was driven by a 5.2% acceleration in motor vehicle and parts production. But this partly reflected difficulties adjusting the data for seasonal fluctuations. Production typically falls in July when automakers idle plants for retooling. However, the temporary plant closures do not always happen, which could throw off the model that the Fed uses to strip out seasonal fluctuations from the data.Output at mines rose. Utilities production soared 5.4% after three straight monthly declines as a heat-wave across many parts of the country increased demand for air conditioning.As a result, industrial production shot up 1.0% after dropping 0.8% in June."We don't think these strong July increases are fully representative of the underlying trends, because it looks like temporary factors helped boost the July readings," said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.Nevertheless, the rise in industrial output bodes well for third-quarter gross domestic product. Economists at Goldman Sachs raised their third-quarter GDP tracking estimate by 0.2 percentage point to a 2.4% annualized rate, citing the strong increases in motor vehicles and utilities production.The economy grew at a 2.4% pace in the second quarter.

Text Content: (Adds detail on issue, background on boards)Aug 16 (Reuters) - Two Pinterest directors have resigned from Nextdoor's board of directors in response to U.S. Justice Department efforts to stop directors from holding similar board positions at rival companies, the department said on Wednesday."Two directors who served on the boards of both Nextdoor and Pinterest resigned from the board of Nextdoor effective Aug. 1, without the directors or either company admitting liability," the department said in a statement.The push to enforce rules about interlocking directorates comes during a broader increase in antitrust enforcement. Antitrust law says that competing companies cannot have the same people on their boards of directors in most cases.The Justice Department did not identify the board members. Nextdoor said in a filing to the government in late July that Leslie Kilgore and Andrea Wishom had decided to step down from Nextdoor's board. Both Kilgore and Wishom are on the Pinterest board of directors, according to that company's website.Neither Pinterest nor Nextdoor immediately responded to a request for comment.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Switzerland’s government hasn’t yet discussed a possible successor for the vacant seat on the central bank’s three-member governing board.“It hasn’t been a topic,” chief spokesman Andre Simonazzi told Bloomberg on Wednesday in Bern after the executive’s first meeting following a six-week summer break.The appointment has been on the government’s radar since March, when the Swiss National Bank announced that Andrea Maechler would be departing at the end of June. The SNB’s supervisory Bank Council proposes candidates, though the executive doesn’t have to follow that recommendation in its final decision.Simonazzi provided no explanation for the delay in the appointment.The lack of action might suggest that the government has yet to receive an official recommendation. Finding a replacement always looked like a challenge: Maechler was both the first and only woman on the SNB’s top panel and the sole official not to come from a German-speaking region of Switzerland.In the interim, alternate SNB board member Thomas Moser — who was Maechler’s deputy — has stepped in to head the department in charge of money markets and foreign exchange.Moser would also be eligible to vote on interest rates, which means that if a new board member isn’t in place on time, he’d have a say at the Sept. 21 policy decision.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Look closely at the contours of Tuesday’s tumble in the S&P 500 and fingerprints of a new market force come into focus.They’re options tied to S&P 500 with a maturity less than 24 hours. A flurry of trading in the contracts known as zero days to expiration, or 0DTE, was the backdrop to a jarring acceleration of the day’s decline, one in which the equity benchmark slid roughly 0.4% in 20 minutes, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s managing director Scott Rubner.According to Rubner, market makers, whose need to keep books balanced often means they must buy or sell stock en masse when options orders cascade in, were forced into action by furious trading in bearish puts with a strike price at 4,440. Those options saw almost 100,000 contracts change hands during the session, or $45 billion in notional value.As their cost spiked to $9 from 70 cents in a short span near the session’s end, it sent market makers on the other side of transactions in a dash for hedges to stay market neutral. In this case, that meant an exodus from equities.“There is not enough liquidity on the screens to handle market makers delta hedging such a dramatic move over a short 20 minute period,” Rubner, who has studied flow of funds for two decades, wrote in a note Wednesday.His analysis is the latest to venture views on the impact of zero-day options on the underlying stock market. Earlier this week, research from Nomura Securities International and Citigroup Inc. showed that trading in 0DTE contracts has exploded to record highs this month, with traders pivoting toward puts. The mushrooming popularity, while likely a consequence of a break in the 10-month equity rally, may have been contributing to intensified intraday swings, according to Nomura.Story continuesUBS Group AG’s trading desk echoed the view. In a note from Tuesday, the team laid out case studies on three particularly busy sessions for zero-day options — July 27, when news about Bank of Japan’s potential hawkish move in monetary policy broke; Aug. 4, the day of the latest US monthly payrolls data; and Aug. 10, when America’s consumer price index was released.The afternoon selloffs on July 27 and Aug. 4, the UBS team found, coincided with a wave of put purchases in zero-day options. On Aug. 10, a morning rout was similarly driven by put trading, and when investors started to book profits on these contracts later in the session, that fueled a market turnaround that then lured traders to chase gains via calls — further pushing stocks higher.Amplifying the influence of zero-day options is a market where it’s getting harder to trade stocks without moving their prices, according to Goldman’s Rubner. By his estimate, the liquidity condition has worsen over the past two weeks, with a measure plunging 56%.The S&P 500 on Tuesday closed below its 50-day moving average for the first time since late March. With its high-low movement averaging 1% in the past five sessions, the index’s gyration is almost double the level seen in July, data compiled by Bloomberg shows.The pickup in volatility, along with receding momentum, threatens to turn rules-based investors into sellers, Rubner warned. Those strategies making asset allocations based on trend and price signals have been among this year’s largest equity buyers.“There has been a clear shift in sentiment over the past few weeks across my persistent IB, zooms, trading calls,” Rubner wrote. “This is no longer a buy the dip market.”©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: LANSING, Mich. (AP) — Michigan State University plans to sell alcohol at select home football games this season following a recent change to state law that permits liquor licenses to be issued to sporting venues at public universities.The Board of Trustees at Michigan State University voted unanimously Wednesday to authorize the school to request liquor licenses to sell alcohol at four football games beginning with a Sept. 16 game against the University of Washington.The board's vote came after Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed legislation in July lifting the state's ban on alcohol being sold at college sporting events. Whitmer said at the time that the new law would help “reduce the likelihood of binge drinking before games,” while also bringing “in a heck of a lot more revenue.”If the liquor licenses are approved by the Michigan Liquor Control Commission, the university also plans to sell alcohol at Spartan Stadium on Sept. 23 against Maryland, Oct. 21 against Michigan and Nov. 4 against Nebraska. Officials said they chose not to sell liquor at the first two home games at the beginning of September because of logistical challenges.Liquor sales will begin one hour before the start of the game and end with five minutes remaining in the third quarter.“For me, it’s about the amenities that our fans are able to appreciate in our stadium,” said MSU athletic director Allan Haller. “I really want our fans to have those same amenities in our stadiums that they have when they travel to support our team at visiting stadiums.”The university also hopes to sell alcohol at venues for other sports, including basketball, baseball, softball and soccer.

Text Content: (Corrects paragraph 27: ICER's final analysis was that Zolgensma was cost effective at a price of $1.1 million to $1.9 million.)*Zolgensma launched as possible "cure," now outcomes paint nuanced picture*Positive results, but add-on therapies increasing, neurologists say*Once world's priciest drug, that raises questions for other gene therapiesBy Deena BeasleyLOS ANGELES, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Baby Ben Kutschke was diagnosed at three months with spinal muscular atrophy, a rare inherited disorder which is the leading genetic cause of death in infancy globally. It leaves children too weak to walk, talk, swallow or even breathe.So when in 2021 his parents heard about Zolgensma – a one-time therapy costing millions of dollars that promises to replace genes needed for the body to control muscles – they had high hopes.They were disappointed.After treatment with the $2.25 million therapy at almost eight months old, Ben was able to hold his head up for a few seconds – a significant milestone, his mother Elizabeth Kutschke told Reuters. But he did not advance to rolling over or sitting up, and after a few weeks doctors recommended the family add another drug to help him."I just started to worry," she said from their home in Berwyn, Illinois. "He wasn't getting worse, but the gradual progress we had seen ... was no longer happening."Ben is one of a growing number of patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) whose doctors are turning to additional drugs on top of the gene therapy, six top U.S. neurologists told Reuters.Their experience raises broader questions around other high-cost gene therapies coming to market, sometimes after accelerated regulatory approvals, drug pricing experts said.Zolgensma, launched in 2019 by Swiss-based healthcare group Novartis as a "potential cure" for SMA, was the most expensive drug in the world at the time.Gene therapies work by replacing genes – the body's blueprint for its development. The gene Zolgensma delivers instructs the body to make a protein vital for muscle control.Story continuesOther SMA therapies need to be taken continuously, but Zolgensma's price was justified by hopes this revolutionary approach could beat the condition once and for all.Zolgensma has been given to more than 3,000 children globally, with 2022 sales of $1.4 billion representing 91% of gene therapy sales worldwide, according to the IQVIA Institute for Human Data Science. In the U.S., where costs are borne by government health programs such as Medicaid as well as private insurance, IQVIA estimated Zolgensma sales totaled $434 million last year.It has worked well for many. Novartis' data presented in March shows that depending on the timing of treatment, most patients have gone on to swallow, breathe, or even walk independently, said Sitra Tauscher-Wisniewski, vice president at Novartis Gene Therapies. Some are able to run and climb.Three of six families interviewed by Reuters whose children received Zolgensma said they were progressing as well as hoped; Ben's was the only one to turn to another treatment.But Novartis' data also shows almost one-third of children in an ongoing study went on to be given other drugs.If gene therapies do fall short, it becomes harder to justify prices that researchers have argued are already poor value."The perception that Zolgensma is going to be a complete cure ... is not coming to fruition from the data we have seen over the last four years," said Dr. Roger Hajjar, director of the Mass General Brigham Gene & Cell Therapy Institute."Following the injection of Zolgensma you are basically going from a deadly disease to a more chronic disease state," he said, adding that many patients would not survive without this treatment.Novartis said Zolgensma has been "transformative," but each child's journey is unique and outcomes can vary. It says there is no evidence additional therapies can help. Notably, it has dropped the term "potentially curative" – common in its analyst calls in 2018 and 2019 – from descriptions of Zolgensma, instead calling it a "one-time treatment.""People still have misconceptions about Zolgensma," Kutschke told Reuters. "It is a treatment, not a cure."IN THE PIPELINENovartis CEO Vasant Narasimhan spelled out the pricing argument in a 2018 call: "Payers appreciate that when you deliver a potentially curative therapy that takes cost out of their healthcare system and enables people to live, hopefully, a more normal life, they are willing to pay and they see the value," he said.The multimillion-dollar pricing strategy is not unique. More recently, the first hemophilia gene therapy approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration was priced by CSL Behring at $3.5 million; 26 more gene therapies are in late-stage development, according to IQVIA.Drugmakers say the long-term benefits are worth it. CSL said it is confident that its treatment can generate cost savings and has offered partial refunds if patients need to resume injections of blood-clotting proteins in the first four years after the therapy.Novartis offers payment by installments – although it said no one in the U.S. has taken them. It also has plans linking payment to how well a patient responds, but said U.S. refunds under them have been rare.The economics of treating the relatively small number of patients make a high price tag imperative for manufacturers."One of the arguments is you're saving all of these millions of dollars down the line," said Stacie Dusetzina, professor of health policy at Nashville's Vanderbilt University School of Medicine."But if you found out later on that oh, actually you have to get most of those other treatments, I think the question is, 'was that price really a fair price to begin with?'"The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER), a drug pricing research group, has said Zolgensma would be cost effective at a price of $1.1 million to $1.9 million.The two other available SMA treatments are also not cheap.Biogen's Spinraza, injected into the spine, has a U.S. list price of $800,000 in the first year followed by maintenance doses at $400,000 a year. Roche's Evrysdi, an oral solution, costs $100,000 to $340,000 per year depending on how much the patient weighs.Both Biogen and Roche said studies of their drugs as treatments for patients who do not respond sufficiently to Zolgensma have been encouraging so far. Biogen's Chief Medical Officer Maha Radhakrishnan said a second drug could still add value given the high cost of caring for severely disabled patients.The fact that some children need treatment with other expensive drugs after Zolgensma shows that the gene therapy represents "poor value," said Steven Pearson, ICER president.It's a headache for health insurers, who usually cover the full cost of Zolgensma upfront: It's not yet clear how to manage a payment plan over time, and that would require more real-world data on how patients respond, said Sree Chaguturu, chief medical officer at CVS Health, which owns health insurer Aetna."How long do you actually need to monitor and track those patients?" he said, noting that Americans commonly move between different insurance plans."DOING AMAZING"Many parents of children with SMA say Zolgensma is worth it.Amanda Cook, a 32-year-old bookkeeper in Lebanon, Virginia, already knew when she gave birth to her son Weston in 2021 that he was diagnosed with SMA: It had led to the death of his older brother, Jackson, at 7 months.Weston had a flaw in the gene that produces a protein critical to the function of cells that move muscles. The lack of that protein, known as SMN (survival motor neuron), results in SMA, which affects fewer than 300 babies a year in the United States.But he had Zolgensma at 11 days old and "is ahead of everything, honestly," Cook said.All therapies have been stopped and he is "doing amazing as a true 2-year old."The treatment works best when infused as soon as possible after birth – some patients can begin to suffer from degeneration before birth – and Ben Kutschke was a relative latecomer.His parents saw him having problems when he was about a month old. Formula spilled from the corners of his mouth. He couldn't hold a pacifier; his doctor suggested they try different sizes but it became clear his condition was serious when Elizabeth heard liquid slipping down his windpipe.Ben was found, like about 60% of cases, to have the most severe form of SMA which often leads to paralysis and death before age two."The earlier and better preserved the nerves are, the more likely you are to have success," said Dr. Jerry Mendell, director of the gene therapy center at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio and principal investigator in the Zolgensma trials.Zolgensma is becoming available to younger babies across the U.S.: Most states screen newborns for it, and health insurers typically cover Zolgensma for children with the most severe form.ANTIBODIESBut even after diagnosis, not all children are immediate candidates.Zolgensma delivers the gene through a modified virus. Ben had already been exposed to the virus in nature and had developed antibodies, which would neutralize the replacement genes in his body.Dr. Russell Butterfield, pediatric neurologist, University of Utah Health and Intermountain Primary Children's Hospital, said it's "not all that rare" for babies to have antibodies to the vector. He put the incidence at 15% to 20%.Babies can also be ineligible due to issues such as liver problems – Zolgensma's label warns it can cause these. Last year, two children in Russia and Kazakhstan died of acute liver failure several weeks after receiving it.Ben was originally treated with Evrysdi, which aims to boost SMN levels directly. It took months for his antibody levels to fall to the point he could start Zolgensma."When they did say the antibodies were down, oh I cried on that phone call," Kutschke said.When he finally received Zolgensma, Ben's hand movements became smoother and he was able to lift his head, "but then after that big rocket forward in progress, it seemed to just stall out," his mother said.The body develops antibodies to the virus used, so each therapy using it can only be administered once. Doctors recommended a third treatment, Biogen's Spinraza."REAL LIFE"The most recent Novartis data, updated in March, shows this was not unusual. Its study found that 24 of 81 children given Zolgensma as of May 2022 had been subsequently treated with other SMA drugs. Novartis declined to provide details on them."There are a whole lot of things that happen in real life circumstances" to affect the utility of treatment with Zolgensma, Mendell said. For less responsive patients, Mendell said it is reasonable to use other treatments.But it can be difficult to get insurance coverage after Zolgensma. Some health plans explicitly exclude add-on therapies if a child received it, according to policies posted on their websites.Kutschke said her insurance company UMR, part of UnitedHealth Group, balked at reimbursing another drug. A spokesperson for UnitedHealth declined to comment.Kutschke said UMR reasoned that Ben "should be fine" after getting Zolgensma – "Which is really heartbreaking because we thought he would be too."It took nearly six months of paperwork and appeals – supported by Ben's medical team – before payment for Spinraza was approved.Since then Ben, who now uses a wheelchair at age 2, began talking a lot more. He was suddenly able to move his lower body, his mother said. (Additional reporting by Eric Cox in Chicago; Edited by Caroline Humer and Sara Ledwith)

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Chinese investors protested outside the office of one of the country’s biggest shadow banks, in a rare show of public outrage after the firm skipped payments on dozens of investment products.Videos of the incident appear to show about two dozen protesters at Zhongrong International Trust Co., demanding payment on high-yield products that were pitched as safe investments. In one of the clips posted on Wechat seen by Bloomberg News, a woman angrily asks: “Why doesn’t the company pay us back?” she says. “It has already matured. Your financial statements said there is a profit.”The protests indicate troubles at the embattled Chinese shadow bank are deeper than previously known, and underscore how the fallout from the real estate slump is spreading to the financial sector. Many trust products sold by Zhongrong and others are backed by housing projects run by troubled developers such as China Evergrande Group.Pressure is building across China’s financial markets given a slew of disappointing economic data, renewed concerns about the property sector and the unfolding crisis in the shadow banking system. Investors are calling for more aggressive easing by Beijing as the incremental policies have so far failed to revive confidence. A selloff in Chinese assets deepened on Wednesday, with the MSCI China Index down as much as 1.3%.Read more: Country Garden Warns on ‘Major Uncertainties’ in Bond PaymentsZhongrong is among the biggest firms in the country’s $2.9 trillion trust industry, which pools savings from wealthy households and corporate clients to make loans and invest in real estate, stocks, bonds and commodities. The firm has 270 high-yield products totaling 39.5 billion yuan ($5.4 billion) due this year, according to data provider Use Trust.Story continuesChinese authorities have already set up a task force to study any possible contagion from the shadow banking group, which manages about $138 billion. The firm said it has no immediate plans to make clients whole.“Given the recent net asset value markdowns and redemptions, we expect growth in trust products to slow, which could result in tighter property financing conditions, and affect banks’ earnings and balance sheets,” Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analyst Shuo Yang wrote in a note.Wang Qiang, board secretary of the firm partly owned by financial giant Zhongzhi Enterprise Group Co., told investors in a meeting earlier this week that the firm missed payments on a batch of products on Aug. 8, adding to delays on at least 10 others since late July, according to people familiar with the matter. At least 30 products are now overdue and Zhongrong also halted redemptions on some short-term instruments, one of the people said.Cash CrunchWang said liquidity at the firm has suddenly dried up. The company is facing a “tsunami” of questions from investors and their own wealth managers, according to people familiar, who asked not to be identified because the meeting was private. Wang asked for patience as the firm seeks to recoup the value of its investments.Zhongzhi is among the private wealth managers that Beijing has been trying to rein in for years to minimize risks for the hundreds of thousands of retail clients who buy these products assuming they’re safe. China is already struggling with a weak economy and fallout from the property slump that’s threatening to push giants like Country Garden Holdings Co. into default. The central bank on Tuesday cut interest rates by the most in three years in a bid to revive growth.According to Bloomberg Economics, the trust sector’s exposure to real estate is about 2.2 trillion yuan, or 10% of total assets as of the end of 2022. Zhongrong is the ninth-biggest trust, with about 600 billion yuan in assets.“The big danger is that a negative feedback loop kicks in, with property stress causing strains in the financial system, undermining credit expansion and depressing growth, which, in turn, exacerbates the slump in the property sector,” Bloomberg Economics said in a note.Zhongrong investors are now losing patience. Many bought the products paying as much as 7% annual interest, betting they would be a safe bet as Chinese stocks and real estate prices tumble.The protesters in Beijing were met by about 10 police and security officers, while a company official tried to keep the peace.One woman is heard shouting: “Give us the money back, or we will die here.” Another says: “Why you don’t give us a clear explanation?”Read more: China Shadow Bank Misses Dozens of Payments as Risks GrowA reporter who visited the Zhongrong office Wednesday afternoon didn’t see any protesters but there was an unusually heavy police presence around the building. Officers were seen sitting in several police vans and cars parked inside and outside the office compound, and other police vehicles were placed on roads nearby.Officers were also watching the area from inside one of the several city buses that were parked at the main gate or nearby. Workers were erecting extra fencing around the building.Police in Beijing didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.Protests over financial disputes are fairly common in China but the authorities are unlikely to tolerate them for long, especially in the capital where authorities prize stability.Police quickly broke up demonstrations in Beijing and other cities late last year over the government’s harsh Covid Zero rules. Officers maintained a presence for days at the site of the unrest to deter any repeat.Shortly afterward, China started dismantling Covid Zero yet still arrested several people on a catch-all charge called “picking quarrels and provoking trouble.” A conviction on that charge can mean up to five years in prison. It is unclear how their cases were resolved.A series of demonstrations also erupted in 2022 in the central province of Henan over a suspected financial scam. Police and protesters clashed as hundreds of people demanded the return of deposits worth up to tens of billions of yuan.(Adds details of missed trust payments throughout)©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Russian drones reportedly hit a key Danube River grain port, sending wheat prices higher, in the latest attack aimed at Ukraine’s crop-export infrastructure.The weapons struck the Ukrainian port of Reni on the Danube overnight and damaged a silo, Romanian media reported Wednesday, citing footage from people living close to the border only a few hundred meters away.Russia was targeting grain infrastructure, and storage suffered from the attack, Oleh Kiper, head of the military administration of the Odesa region, said earlier on Telegram, without naming the affected port.Wheat futures in Chicago rose as much as 1.4%, rebounding from the lowest since early June. Paris milling wheat also rose for the first time in three sessions.The escalation of hostilities in the breadbasket region could compound trade disruptions, after Russia pulled out of the Black Sea grain deal last month. That has made river channels — as well as rail and road routes — increasingly important to ferry Ukrainian crops abroad, with farmers in the midst of collecting this year’s harvests.Russian drones also targeted ports on the Danube earlier this month, including Izmail. Such attacks risk hampering Ukraine’s trade potential for the longer-term.The violence was condemned by Romanian Foreign Minister Luminita Odobescu, who accused Russia of “flagrant violations” of international law.Wheat is still about 20% lower this year as harvests progress in the Northern Hemisphere, giving the global market an influx of fresh supply.The US Department of Agriculture last week raised its estimate for Russian shipments in the 2023-24 season, and boosted its forecast for US wheat stocks by more than analysts had expected on average.Story continues--With assistance from Volodymyr Verbyany.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Municipal-bond investors have to assess an unusual risk as part of a $113 million bond offering next week: The historic strikes that are paralyzing business for much of Hollywood.The seller of the debt, a group affiliated with the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, is familiar to muni-market participants because it has issued bonds several times for its Los Angeles museum, which opened in 2021.However, this offering, which will refinance old, higher interest-rate debt, comes against a troubled backdrop for the industry. The Writers Guild of America went on strike May 2, seeking higher pay and other changes amid the rise of streaming TV and artificial intelligence. The strike, coupled with one by screen actors that began in July, has largely halted production of new films and scripted TV shows.Read More: Hollywood Offers Writers New Deal With Iger, Netflix BackingThat poses a risk for next year’s Oscars ceremony, scheduled for March. The show — one of the most-watched non-sports event in the US — generates significant revenue that helps pay off the bonds.“Both the writers’ and actors’ strikes are active and, if not resolved a few months in advance of the 2024 Oscars award show, the strikes could negatively impact the show or result in the postponement or cancellation of the 2024 Oscars award show,” the bond documents say. “In addition, the strikes could result in fewer films being available for Oscar consideration either at the 2024 Oscar award show or at future Oscar award shows.”Millions WatchThe 2023 ceremony drew 19.9 million viewers in the US and 17.5 million viewers abroad, according to the bond documents. It has only been postponed four times since its inception in 1929: after a flood in 1938, to observe Martin Luther King Jr.’s funeral, after the attempted assassination of President Ronald Reagan, and in 2021 because of the pandemic, according to bond documents.Story continuesThe bonds are backed by revenue from the so-called obligated group that is borrowing the money for the museum. It’s composed of five related nonprofits: the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the Academy Museum Foundation, the Academy Foundation, the Vine Street Archive Foundation, and the Archival Foundation. The group has about $400 million of outstanding debt, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The group gets revenue from sources including the awards ceremony, the museum’s operations, donations and investment income. A decrease in revenue generated by the awards show could have a material impact on the group’s ability to make bond payments, the bond documents note.The Oscars ceremony is especially crucial because of the academy’s contracts with broadcasters: The Academy Awards and related activities generated $137 million of unrestricted revenue in fiscal 2022, bond documents say. Revenue from the museum - such as through ticket sales - came to about $23 million.“The biggest concern is if the strike goes on for too long and the Oscars broadcast gets canceled,” said Dan Solender, head of municipals at Lord, Abbett & Co. He said he doesn’t see the strikes as posing a longer-term risk at this point for the debt.The bonds have an Aa2 investment-grade credit rating from Moody’s Investors Service, two steps below the top rank with a stable outlook, the ratings company said this month.The museum describes itself as the largest in the US devoted to the arts, sciences, history and social impact of movies and film artists. It drew 700,000 people in its first 12 months.Bloomberg Philanthropies is partnering with the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures to fund a digital enhancement effort for the museum.Deep PocketsPhilanthropic donations also support the payments on the municipal bonds. Walt Disney Co. Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger, actor Tom Hanks and actress Annette Bening have spearheaded fundraising for the museum, raising about $388 million, the bond documents say.The bonds will be sold by the California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank, known as IBank, which allows a variety of issuers in the state to sell munis.A spokesperson for IBank declined to comment, as did representatives for the Academy and for Wells Fargo & Co., the underwriter on the bond sale.The museum foundation expects the bond sale to produce cost savings of approximately $1.1 million in annual debt-service payments, according to a document from the IBank. The average interest rate on the bond sale won’t exceed 6%, it says.--With assistance from Christopher Palmeri.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: By Jorge Garcia and Sandra StojanovicLAHAINA, Hawaii Aug 16 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden will travel to Hawaii next week to survey the devastation left in the wake of the deadly wildfires that ravaged the Maui resort town of Lahaina last week, the White House said on Wednesday.Biden on Monday will meet with first responders and survivors, as well as federal, state and local officials, the White House said in a statement.The inferno killed at least 106 people after racing from grasslands outside town into Lahaina last Tuesday and charring a 5-square-mile (13-square-km) area of town in hours. The fire, which caught residents by surprise, destroyed 2,200 buildings and caused an estimated $5.5 billion in damage, officials said.A week later, traumatized residents of the West Maui town have grown weary from living off relief supplies while many have been kept from inspecting their homes and still left awaiting news of their missing loved ones. Hundreds of people are still believed to be missing.Up to 20 cadaver dogs have led search teams on a block-by-block search of the ashes. The teams have covered only 27% of the disaster area as of Tuesday, Governor Josh Green said in a televised address on Tuesday. Some 80% to 90% of the zone is expected to have been swept by the weekend.(Additional reporting by Brendan O'Brien in Chicago)

Text Content: (Updates death toll in first paragrap)By Stephen CulpAug 16 (Reuters) - The Maui wildfires in Hawaii have killed at least 106, making it the deadliest U.S. wildfire in more than a century, with hundreds of people unaccounted for nearly a week after the disaster. The causes of the Hawaii wildfires, which started the night of Aug. 8, have not yet been determined. Search teams with cadaver dogs have combed through .WHAT IS THE DEADLIEST WILDFIRE IN US HISTORY? The Peshtigo PeshtigoWisconsin started Oct. 8, 1871 and killed 1,152, according to the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA).At the time, Peshtigo Peshtigoanent home to about 2,000 people, although its population swelled with immigrants looking for work in the lumbering, manufacturing and railroad industries.The town was surrounded by pine forest, all of its structures were made of wood, including its sidewalks. Sawdust from the town's woodworking factory - the largest in the world - covered everything. On Oct. 8, 1871, following a dry winter, spring and summer, the town was a particularly vulnerable when a low-pressure system kicked up a strong wind and transformed a nearby brushfirebrushfireonflagration, which survivors described as a wall of fire that consumed the settlement within minutes, according to the Peshtigo Peshtigoal Society.HOW MANY DIED IN THE CLOQUET ACLOQUETT HINCKLEY FIRES? The Maui wildfire is the deadliest since the Cloquet FCloquetOctober 1918, when railroad sparks ignited a wildfire that raged for more than four days, decimating northern Minnesota, according to the Library of Congress.The NFPA set a death toll of 453 as a result of what is known today as the Cloquet/MCloquetke Fires.In 1894, amid conditions strikingly similar to the Peshtigo Peshtigoyears earlier, a breeze kicked up and transformed several small, scattered fires near a cluster of logging communities into a wall of flame that destroyed Hinckley, Mission Creek, Sandstone, Miller, Partridge and Pokegama,Pokegamang to the Hinckley government website.Story continuesThe fire consumed 400 square miles and killed 418 people.WHAT IS A WILDFIRE AND HOW VULNERABLE ARE US HOMES?The Federal Emergency Management Association (FEMA) defines wildfires as "an unplanned, unwanted fire burning in a natural area, such as a forest, grassland, or prairie."Nearly half the land area in the United States is composed of forest, shrubland, and grassland, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).There are currently almost 45 million U.S. homes located near or adjacent to such areas.The National Interagency Fire Center estimates there are 71.8 million properties in the United States that are "at some level of risk from wildfire."Since 2018, wildfires in the United States have destroyed nearly 63,000 structures, the majority of which were homes.WHAT CAUSED THESE FIRES TO BE SO DEADLY?The causes of some fires, including the most recent in Hawaii, are not known. However, dry and windy conditions were present for both the Maui fire this year and the California Camp Fire in 2018, as well as the Peshtigo PeshtigoWisconsin and the Hinckley fires in Minnesota.WHAT ROLE IS CLIMATE CHANGE PLAYING IN WILDFIRES?Climate change increases hot and dry conditions that help fires spread faster, burn longer and rage more intensely. Hotter weather also saps moisture from vegetation, turning it into dry fuel that helps fires to spread.Climate change is not the only factor in wildfires. Forest management and ignition sources also play important roles. Some actions can help to limit severe blazes, such as setting controlled fires that mimic the low-intensity fires in natural ecosystem cycles, or introducing gaps within forests to stop blazes rapidly spreading over large areas.According to the EPA, since the 1980s, of the 10 years with the largest acreage lost to wildfires, all have occurred since 2004 and coincide with the warmest years on record nationwide.Peak wildfire season is starting earlier in the year.In 2022, there were 66,255 wildfires in the United States, compared with 18,229 in 1983, when record keeping began, per the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)."Climate change, including increased heat, extended drought, and a thirsty atmosphere, has been a key driver in increasing the risk and extent of wildfires in the western United States during the last two decades," according to the NOAA.(Reporting by Stephen Culp; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)

Text Content: By Lucia MutikaniWASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. single-family homebuilding surged in July amid an acute shortage of previously owned houses, but mortgage rates climbing back to near two-decade highs could stifle growth in new construction.Single-family housing starts, which account for the bulk of homebuilding, jumped 6.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 983,000 units last month, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday. Data for June was revised to show starts falling to a rate of 921,000 units, instead of 935,000 units as previously reported.The increase in groundbreaking was led by the West, where single-family starts soared 28.5%. Starts rose 12.5% in the Midwest. But they fell 3.4% in the Northeast and declined 1.3% in the densely populated South.The housing market, pummeled by the Federal Reserve's aggressive monetary policy tightening, has been showing signs of stabilizing at a lower level, with homebuilding and new home sales even rising. But further improvement looks likely to be curtailed by the renewed increase in mortgage rates.The average rate on the popular 30-year fixed mortgage has increased to 6.96% over the past weeks, according to data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac. The rate is within striking distance of the 7.08% seen in late October and early November, which was the highest since April 2002.Mortgage rates near 7% were attributed to the ebb in confidence among homebuilders in August, with the National Association of Home Builders noting that more builders were offering incentives to attract buyers amid expectations of lower sales.Starts for housing projects with five units or more were unchanged at a rate of 460,000 units in July. Demand for rental accommodation, largely driven by higher mortgage rates sidelining some potential home buyers, is slowing. There is also a record stock of multi-family housing under construction.Overall housing starts increased 3.9% to a rate of 1.452 million units in July. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast starts rising to a rate of 1.448 million units.Story continuesPermits for future construction of single-family homes rose 0.6% in July to a rate of 930,000 units. Single-family building permits tumbled in the Northeast, but rose in the Midwest and South. They were unchanged in the West.Permits for housing projects with five units or more fell 0.2% to a rate of 464,000 units, the lowest level since October 2020. Overall building permits edged up 0.1% to a rate of 1.442 million units last month.The number of houses approved for construction that are yet to be started fell 0.4% to 277,000 units. The single-family homebuilding backlog dropped 0.7% to 140,000 units, while the completions rate for this segment increased 1.3% a rate of 1.018 million units.The inventory of single-family housing under construction fell 0.7% to a rate of 678,000 units.The stock of multi-family housing under construction increased 1.1% to 986,000 units, the highest level since the government started tracking the series in 1970.(Reporting By Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)

Text Content: GENEVA (AP) — Switzerland's government has lined up with the European Union's 11th round of sanctions against Russia over its war in Ukraine.The Swiss executive branch decided Wednesday that the new measures adopted by the European bloc on June 23 would take effect later in the day in the Alpine country.Switzerland, which is not a member of the 27-country bloc, is a key EU trading partner and has followed every set of its sanctions against Russian companies and individuals since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched an invasion of Ukraine in February last year.The 11th round of EU sanctions aims to close loopholes so that goods vital to Putin’s war effort don’t get through to Russia by way of countries that trade with the EU and have maintained a business-as-usual relationship with Moscow.The multiple rounds of sanctions have affected banks, companies and markets, and even parts of the sensitive energy sector. More than 1,000 officials are subject to asset freezes and travel bans.Switzerland on June 28 implemented sanctions on more than 100 other companies and people after the EU's move days earlier and will adopt the rest of the 11th-round sanctions “that are relevant to Switzerland” on Wednesday, the government said.The Swiss measure will ban exports of some “dual-use goods” — with possible civilian and military uses — to another 87 companies, and some types of electronic components and precursors to chemical weapons will also be affected, the government said.“In the financial sector, the existing ban on selling securities denominated in Swiss francs or in an official currency of an EU member state to Russian nationals and entities was expanded,” it said. “The sale of securities to Russian citizens and entities is now prohibited, regardless of the currency.”

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- As the acronym “ESG” ends up among the most hated on Wall Street, the financial cost of ignoring it is making headlines.In just the past few weeks, a string of textbook environmental, social and governance issues — spanning workers’ rights to extreme weather — erupted in a number of major stocks.The world’s biggest publicly traded package courier, United Parcel Service Inc., was forced to issue a profit warning that drove down its shares, after it said a tentative labor agreement will add to its costs. The firm agreed to raise wages for some workers, bump up the amount of paid vacation and improve working conditions. That includes installing air conditioning in new vehicles rendered unbearably hot by extreme heat.That was followed by the world’s largest tour operator, TUI AG, which lost more than a tenth of its market value in the first half of August alone after environmental devastation in the form of wild fires in Southern Europe destroyed some of the region’s popular holiday destinations. The company said it will incur costs of about €25 million due to the fires, while analysts at Bernstein said “it remains to be seen” what the full impact will be.And then this week, investors learned that lawsuits have been filed against Hawaiian Electric Industries Inc., alleging its power lines may have exacerbated the deadliest US wildfires in more than a century. Its shares plunged roughly 40%, and its municipal bonds also fell.While no official cause has been identified for the fire, the utility has faced criticism for not turning off power despite weather forecasters’ warnings that dry, gusty winds could create critical conditions. Ratings of Hawaiian Holdings, the parent of Hawaiian Airlines Inc., were also downgraded by Moody’s Investors Service.Story continues“There’s still this cognitive dissonance between using the label ‘ESG’ and accounting for the business impacts from these real-world issues,” said Rob Du Boff, senior ESG analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “People see ESG as bad, but when you say that wildfires have financial risks, they’ll agree with you.”Read more: Hawaiian Electric Extends Record Slump With Future in DoubtESG was coined back in 2004 by United Nations staffers as a way for investors and bankers to weigh key risks and opportunities such as rising temperatures, worker disputes and corporate malfeasance, and to determine their impacts on profits.Sustainability purists have since bemoaned the finance industry’s embrace of ESG as little more than a marketing gimmick. Meanwhile, Republicans have attacked ESG, casting it as part of a leftist agenda that threatens American capitalism.Against that backdrop, investors and bankers are avoiding saying “ESG” in meetings with clients, according to a recent Bloomberg survey. However, they’re still integrating what ESG stands for in their work, the same survey showed.The list of recent investor losses tied to ESG-related events is long. In July, the largest US telecoms companies, AT&T Inc., saw its shares sink after the Wall Street Journal reported that its cables contained toxic lead. Shares of Verizon Communications Inc. also fell as investors reacted to the news.Read More: AT&T Says Less Than 10% of Network Has Lead Covered CablesRepublicans had dubbed July “ESG month,” as GOP lawmakers held a succession of congressional hearings to push back on Wall Street’s ESG efforts. But then July ended up being the planet’s hottest month on record, forcing investors and businesses to acknowledge the fallout of extreme heat as well as its social ramifications.Even if the rhetoric surrounding ESG dies down, “the actual underlying issues are only getting louder and louder,” Du Boff said.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- For months, Elon Musk has pinned much of the blame for Tesla Inc.’s price cuts on central banks.Now, he’s discounting in one of its most important markets even as monetary policy becomes more accommodative.The People’s Bank of China unexpectedly lowered a key interest rate by the most since 2020 on Tuesday, the second reduction since June. The day before that surprise move, Tesla marked down multiple versions of the Model Y sport utility vehicle in China. The day after, the company cut prices of Model S sedans and Model X SUVs in inventory.Tesla’s chief executive officer has repeatedly pointed the finger at costlier borrowing as Tesla has brought down the prices of its vehicles this year. He’s been particularly critical of the Federal Reserve, which resumed interest-rate hikes last month after a pause in June.Sure enough, the cost of Teslas continue to drop in the US. On Tuesday, the company introduced new lower-range iterations of the Model S and X that are $10,000 cheaper than previous base versions of the vehicles.But the moves Tesla is making in China suggest there’s potential for the company to have to keep bringing down the cost of its vehicles for reasons other than interest rates.The country’s central bank acted shortly before the release of disappointing economic data for July. On Wednesday, the PBOC took further measures to shore up the financial system, injecting the largest amount of short-term cash since February. Renewed concerns about China’s property sector and shadow banking system have sparked a selloff across assets.Tesla’s discounting may well reinforce this gloom. Musk said during an earnings call last month that he believed the company possessed a unique ability among carmakers to track how demand is trending, describing an auto-generated email he receives daily.Story continues“It's like a real-time finger on the pulse of Earth,” he said. “We adjust course according to what the mood of the public is. Buying a new car is a big decision for the vast majority of people, so anytime there is economic uncertainty, people generally pause on new-car buying at least to see what happens.”Tesla is expected to have fresh product soon that could help lure consumers off the sidelines. Musk has said production will dip this quarter because of downtime for factory upgrades, and the company’s Shanghai plant has been preparing to make an updated version of the Model 3 sedan.The spate of price cuts on other vehicles only raise the stakes for that refresh. It may need to be a hit in order for Tesla to overcome conditions its CEO has complained have been difficult to predict.“One day, it seems like the world economy is falling apart, and the next day, everything’s fine,” Musk said last month. “I don't know what the hell is going on, to be totally frank.”©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- The market for new preferred shares in the US is reopening after a near half-year freeze, raising hopes that this crucial source of capital — especially for the nation’s major lenders — is returning to normal.Money manager Apollo Global Management Inc. is offering $250 million of preferreds on Wednesday, following Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which raised $1.5 billion of its own on Monday, and Wells Fargo & Co., which recently replaced a divisive security.The new issues mark the return of sizable deals in the primary market for preferred shares, after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Credit Suisse’s demise sent ripples through the market for subordinated securities globally. After about five months without any eye-catching issuance, some household names are once again seeing a window to sell new preferred shares.“The cash sitting on the sidelines has to be invested and issuers have to issue,” said Allen Hassan, head of preferred-stock trading at Ziegler Capital Markets. “There has to be more confidence in the market since, up to now, you’ve had a lack of supply and lack of conviction on the buyside.”Investors are drawn to preferreds because of the beefy yields offered by companies as compensation for the securities being subordinate to all types of debt and having an uncertain time frame for repayment. The lack of new offerings of preferred shares for the past few months — as banking woes drove borrowing costs higher — left a hole in the market. Despite an active secondary market, new issuance remains the venue to buy preferred shares in bulk.“We really like the resumption of supply,” said Douglas Baker, head of preferred securities at Nuveen. “What we’re seeing these days could prove to be a vintage of preferreds a year from now. You get high coupons and large deal sizes, which is important from a liquidity perspective.”Story continuesBanks in the US can sell preferreds to raise — or replace — core capital, while companies in other sectors tend to use them to pad their balance sheets and bolster credit ratings. This became harder after yields rose earlier this year, but borrowing costs are now at levels that make it worthwhile for some to come to the market.Most banks also stood on the sidelines from issuing preferred shares because they expected the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, said Jesse Rosenthal, head of US financials at CreditSights Inc. But now that the market has settled into a higher-for-longer rate environment, banks are encouraged to refinance their preferreds to lock in a lower rate.“The thought was that maybe rates would have peaked by now, but instead it just keeps on getting extended,” said Arnold Kakuda, senior credit analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “So maybe some are throwing in the towel and saying rates are going to remain elevated, let’s just do this now.”Goldman Sachs sold a perpetual callable after five years at 7.5% in order to repay an older issue currently paying 9.27%. Indications of interest for the note amounted to $6.25 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Last week, Wells Fargo completed the refinancing of a note that divided opinion on Wall Street back in May, as some banks made unexpected decisions while shifting away from Libor, which was phased out at the end of June.The San Francisco-based lender’s new issue came at 7.625% against a fixed-for-life rate that would have been almost 9% in the replaced series.Still, preferred shares are yet to recover fully from the turmoil earlier this year. The net asset value of a preferred-focused exchange-traded fund by BlackRock’s iShares remains below pre-SVB levels and only marginally higher since the start of the year.But the budding preferred-issuance revival could open up further money-making opportunities, encouraging more investors to weigh in.“August has been busier than expected and the fourth quarter will be interesting,” said Ziegler’s Hassan. “You probably need the smart guys to make a lot of money before more people start to jump in.”(Updates with investor comment in sixth paragraph, adds section for other credit news.)©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: (Adds official comment, background)By Holger HansenBERLIN, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The German government has retreated from a plan to legally commit itself to meeting NATO's 2% military spending target on an annual basis, a government source told Reuters on Wednesday.A corresponding clause in a draft of the budget financing law passed by the cabinet of Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Wednesday was deleted at short notice, the source said.The change means that Germany will be able to stick to its current pledge of meeting the 2% target on average over a five-year period.This wording is softer than Scholz's original pledge in a speech on Feb 27, 2022, in which he announced a "Zeitenwende" or sea change three days after Russia's invasion of Ukraine."From now on, we will invest more than 2% of the GDP into our defence year after year," Scholz said at the time.A German government spokesperson declined to comment on the particulars of the draft law.NATO allies have criticised Berlin strongly in the past for not spending 2% of its gross domestic product on defence annually.It is unclear whether Berlin will keep military spending over this threshold once a 100 billion euro ($101 billion) special fund to bring the Bundeswehr back up to standard is used up.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Europe’s heat wave is spreading, with wildfires raging on a Spanish island and people in southeast France told to stay indoors for most of the day.Above-normal temperatures are forecast across the continent this week, with the hottest conditions seen at the end of the weekend, according to forecaster Maxar Technologies Inc. Such extreme weather is becoming more frequent from the US to China, bringing fires, floods and violent storms as climate change increases the intensity of heat waves. That comes after the world’s hottest ever month in July.On Tenerife in Spain’s Canary islands, 150 firefighters and 50 military personnel battled a wildfire that prompted the evacuation of five villages and could could take more than a day to bring under control. The outbreak comes weeks after the neighboring island of La Palma was hit by blazes that forced more than 4,000 residents from their homes.In France, rising temperatures prompted an orange warning for Lyon and Grenoble by Europe’s network of national meteorological services, which told people in those areas that “everyone is in danger, even those in good health” and warned them not to go out between 11am and 9pm. French nuclear production is also likely to be curbed from Saturday because of cooling water restrictions.Over the next few days, southern and central France will reach 5C to 9C (9F to 16F) above normal, according to Maxar. Marseille will hit 35C on Saturday with the mercury not dropping below 30.5C for more than a week, the forecaster said in a daily report. Paris is also poised to get hotter early next week.Read more: EDF Likely to Curb Nuclear Output From Saturday Amid Hot WeatherStory continuesIn Germany, where the heat wave has caused panic as the nation isn’t equipped for such hot conditions, temperatures in Frankfurt will peak at 31.5C on Tuesday, with a few degrees below that through this week.Further south, a sub-Saharan anti-cyclone is ramping up the heat in Italy, with temperatures set to peak at 42C in Sardinia and 38C in Rome, Florence and most of the Po Valley, according to Italy’s Il Meteo.The latest place to enjoy some heat after a prolonged period of cold and wet weather is Amsterdam, where temperatures will fluctuate from 2 to 4C above the norm, reaching 26.5C on Friday, according to Maxar.(Updates with Tenerife wildfires in first, third paragraphs, comment from Maxar in second.)©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: By Greg Roumeliotis and Emma-Victoria Farr(Reuters) -ArcelorMittal SA, the world's second-largest steelmaker, is considering a potential offer for U.S. Steel Corp, three people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.ArcelorMittal is discussing a possible offer with its investment bankers, and there is no certainty that it will press ahead with it, the sources said.If it does launch a bid, it could mark the escalation of a bidding war that is already underway for U.S. Steel, following offers from Cleveland-Cliffs Inc and Esmark Inc for more than $7 billion.The sources requested anonymity because the deliberations are confidential. Representatives for ArcelorMittal and U.S. Steel did not immediately respond to requests for comment.U.S. Steel shares rose 5.2% to $31.81 in New York on Wednesday afternoon. That compares to bids from Cleveland-Cliffs and Esmark that were both worth $35 per share when submitted. Esmark's offer is all cash, while Cleveland-Cliffs would pay for the deal half with cash and half with its own stock.ArcelorMittal's deliberations come after U.S. Steel said on Sunday it had launched a process to explore interest from potential acquirers. The United Steelworkers union supports Cleveland-Cliffs' bid, however U.S. Steel has rebuffed it as "unreasonable".U.S. Steel became an acquisition target following several quarters of falling revenue and declining profits, as it struggled with high raw material and energy costs.ArcelorMittal, like its peers, has also been grappling with a slowdown in demand, as global economic growth slows. Last month it reported a second-quarter profit of $2.6 billion, half that of a year ago.ArcelorMittal has said that global steel demand excluding China is expected to grow 1-2% this year, down from a previously forecast range of 2-3%, due to higher U.S. interest rates and weak construction activity in Europe.(Reporting by Greg Roumeliotis in New York and Emma- Victoria Farr in Frankfurt; Editing by Kirsten Donovan)

Source: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/federal-minutes-too-high-inflation-180532661.html
Text Content: WASHINGTON (AP) — Most Federal Reserve officials last month still regarded high inflation as an ongoing threat that could require further interest rate increases, according to the minutes of their July 25-26 meeting released Wednesday.At the same time, the officials saw “a number of tentative signs that inflation pressures could be abating." It was a mixed view that echoed Chair Jerome Powell's noncommittal stance about future rate hikes at a news conference after the meeting.According to the minutes, the Fed's policymakers also felt that despite signs of progress on inflation, it remained well above their 2% target. They “would need to see more data ... to be confident that inflation pressures were abating” and on track to return to their target.At the meeting, the Fed decided to raise its benchmark rate for the 11th time in 17 months in its ongoing drive to curb inflation. But in a statement after the meeting, it provided little guidance about when — or whether — it might raise rates again.Most investors and economists have said they believe July's rate hike will be the last. Earlier this week, economists at Goldman Sachs projected that the Fed will actually start to cut rates by the middle of next year.

Source: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-imposing-fee-sellers-ship-155714760.html
Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. is imposing a new fee on merchants who don’t use the company’s logistics services, a change many of these sellers consider coercive and surprising since the US government is poised to file an antitrust lawsuit against the e-commerce giant.Thousands of third-party sellers who ship products themselves will start paying a 2% fee on each sale in October, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg. That’s on top of the commission — usually 15% — that merchants already pay Amazon to sell products on the popular web store.Several merchants interviewed by Bloomberg interpreted the new fee as an attempt to pressure them into using Amazon’s logistics services rather than fulfilling orders themselves. The company didn’t explain to sellers why the levy was required, but told Bloomberg it will help cover the costs of running a separate infrastructure and measuring its effectiveness.Amazon has been accused of having too much power over the some 2 million merchants who use its platform, which captures about 37.6% of all online spending in the US, according to Insider Intelligence, or about six times more than its closest online competitor Walmart Inc. The Federal Trade Commission is in the final stages of preparing an antitrust case against Amazon, and the timing of the new fee took some merchants and consultants by surprise.“We’re sitting here waiting for the FTC to take action against Amazon for antitrust issues, and this fee shows Amazon is not scared at all,” said Jason Boyce, whose Avenue7Media helps about 100 businesses sell products online.In recent years, Amazon has been ratcheting up fees on merchants, who typically pay for advertising and logistics to help maximize their sales. The business has become increasingly important to the company as sales growth in the core online operation slows. Seller services generated $32.3 billion in the second quarter, up 18% from the same period a year earlier and more than the profitable cloud services business. Last year, for the first time, seller fees began gobbling up about half the cost of each sale, making it harder for merchants to make a profit.Story continuesThe new fee targets merchants who use Seller Fulfilled Prime, a service that lets them handle logistics themselves and still get an Amazon Prime badge, which lets customers know they can expect quick delivery. These merchants often sell bulkier items such as furniture that don’t mesh well with Amazon’s highly automated warehouses, which are designed to mostly handle smaller products.Amazon launched Seller Fulfilled Prime in 2015 as a way to expand inventory without overloading its fulfillment centers. It closed enrollment in the program a few years later saying merchants were having difficulty meeting Amazon’s delivery standards. Amazon in June announced it would again open enrollment for Seller Fulfilled Prime, a move the company saw as a way to appease regulators investigating it for antitrust issues, according to people familiar with the matter.Amazon informed merchants about the new fee last week.One office furniture merchant enrolled in Seller Fulfilled Prime said the fee will cost his company approximately $1 million a year, forcing it to raise prices. He will probably continue to use the service because Amazon has so many customers but notes that he’s not getting anything extra in return for paying the fee.Another merchant also expected to raise prices to cover the new fee and said that, for many merchants using the service, the 2% levy will wipe out as much as one-third of already meager profit margins. He also said Amazon only gave sellers a few weeks notice, making it difficult to adjust because inventory had already been ordered for the busy holiday shopping season.Both sellers requested anonymity for fear of retaliation from Amazon.“We are excited to offer Seller Fulfilled Prime to sellers as a way to independently handle fulfillment of their products while also making those products available to Prime customers with fast, free delivery, great customer service and free returns,” Amazon spokesperson Jonathon Hillson said.Amazon’s seller fees have been a focus of regulators and lawmakers since at least 2019, when a merchant accused Amazon of using its dominance in e-commerce to force sellers to use its logistics services. The allegation, since echoed by multiple sellers, has emerged as a focus of the FTC’s antitrust case against Amazon, according to people familiar with the situation.Juozas Kaziukenas, founder and chief executive officer of Marketplace Pulse, which monitors online sales, says Amazon has been making it harder and harder in recent years for merchants to qualify for Seller Fulfilled Prime. The upshot: “Most sellers use Fulfillment By Amazon instead.”©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — The Netherlands has fallen into a recession after exports and household spending fell back amid rising interest rates intended to rein in inflation, the country's statistics office reported Wednesday.The economy declined by 0.3% in the second quarter after shrinking 0.4% in the first three months of the year, Statistics Netherlands reported.The Netherlands, a small nation that has long punched above its weight in global trade, is now treading water after its robust rebound following the global COVID-19 pandemic, said the statistics office’s chief economist, Peter Hein van Mulligen."After the coronavirus dip, the Dutch economy recovered much quicker and stronger than the rest of Europe. In the last year that has turned around," he said.The economies in the Netherlands' neighbors, France and Belgium, both grew in the last quarter while another neighbor, European economic powerhouse Germany, stagnated.Caretaker Economic Affairs Minister Micky Adriaansens insisted that the country's economic foundation remains good, even as consumers and businesses grapple with the effects of inflation and interest rate hikes.Adriaansens said she wants to keep “investing in the long-term challenges and looking at where we can tackle unnecessary price rises.”While the country is officially in recession, the labor market remains strong, with unemployment close to all-time lows at 3.6%. “For every hundred job-seekers, there are 122 jobs,” said Hein van Mulligen.The news that the country slid into a recession comes as the Netherlands faces political uncertainly after the ruling coalition resigned over the summer. A national election is scheduled for late November and is likely to usher in a long round of negotiations to form a new coalition.

Text Content: NEW YORK (AP) — Some Bank of Ireland customers were able to withdraw money they did not have Tuesday and early Wednesday after an hours-long technical glitch that also halted many of the bank's online services.The outage allowed some customers to transfer and withdraw funds “above their normal limits,” the Bank of Ireland said. Customers could withdraw up to €500 ($546) with their Bank of Ireland card, the bank confirmed to The Associated Press Wednesday. They could also transfer funds from their Bank of Ireland account to a different account and withdraw up to €1,000 ($1,091), the bank said.As word spread on social media, images and video footage appeared to show people lining up at ATMs in hopes of receiving the “free money.” As more people appeared to arrive at ATMs in large numbers on Tuesday, images of police standing on guard close by began to appear on social media.An Garda Síochána, Ireland’s national police, said it was “aware of an unusual volume of activity at some ATMs across the country” — and that “local decisions were made depending on the public safety and public order presented to members of An Garda Síochána” on a case-by-case basis.The Bank of Ireland, however, warns that all withdrawals will still appear as a debit on customer accounts.“These transfers and withdrawals will be applied to customers’ accounts today,” the bank said in a Wednesday statement. “We urge any customer who may find themselves in financial difficulty due to overdrawing on their account to contact us.”Beyond the withdrawals, the technical issue also impacted many online and mobile app services. On social media, a number of frustrated customers reported not being able to access their accounts or see payments. Some stressed the difficulty of buying food and other essentials without being able to check their account balances — and others noted that this wasn't the first times a technical issue at the bank has impacted them, pointing to a June glitch that similarly cut off access to online services.Story continuesThe Bank of Ireland said that its online services were working again Wednesday, but that the bank's app may be slow as the bank continues to catch up on processing payments. Overnight payments should appear throughout the day, the bank said.“We sincerely apologise for the disruption this outage caused – we know we fell far below the standards our customers expect from us,” the bank said.Ireland's Minister for Finance Michael McGrath later announced he had asked the Central Bank of Ireland, which regulates the Bank of Ireland, “to establish a full account" of the outage and what can be done to avoid such issues in the future.“Financial service providers have to do whatever is required to ensure continuity of service for their customers,” McGrath said in a statement. "Disruption to banking services can have a significant effect on people’s personal lives and on the running of businesses. Customers rightly have an expectation of a high quality of service and to be able to have uninterrupted access to services.”In a statement sent to The Associated Press on Wednesday, a spokesperson for the Central Bank confirmed that it was working with Bank of Ireland to resolve the issues impacting customers and was continuing to monitor the situation.

Text Content: (Adds U.S. and Chinese reactions)GENEVA, Aug 16 (Reuters) - A World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute settlement panel on Wednesday found that China had acted inconsistently with its WTO obligations by imposing additional duties on certain U.S. imports in response to U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminium.The office of the U.S. Trade Representative said it was pleased with the WTO decision, adding that China had "illegally retaliated with sham 'safeguard' tariffs."China's Commerce Ministry said it had noted the WTO panel decision and demanded that the United States immediately lift tariffs imposed on steel and aluminium imports.The U.S. imposed a 25% duty on steel imports and a 10% duty on aluminium imports in March 2018 based on the Donald Trump administration's "Section 232" national security investigation into steel and aluminium imports.The panel recommended that China bring its "WTO-inconsistent measures into conformity".Beijing could appeal the ruling, which would send it into a legal void because Washington has blocked appointments to the WTO Appellate Body, rendering it incapable of giving a judgment.The WTO ruled last year that the U.S. move had also violated international trade rules, with Washington also appealing the decision.In response to the U.S. duties, China announced that additional duties of between 15% and 25% would apply to certain imports originating in the United States, a measure challenged by Washington.The United States agreed to remove tariffs on EU imports in 2021 but President Joe Biden's administration has otherwise kept in place the metals tariffs that were one of the centrepieces of Trump's America First strategy.

The negative return, though not the first this year, signifies that the interest income the assets throw off is more than offset by the price declines associated with rising yields.While only the longest-maturity Treasury yields reached new 2023 highs this week, their greater price sensitivity to yield changes eroded what was left of a year-to-date gain that exceeded 4% in early April. Ten- and 30-year Treasury yields rose to the highest levels since October Tuesday after stronger-than-anticipated July retail sales data challenged expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts beginning next near.The US economy’s surprising resilience in the face of Fed rate increases totaling more than 5 percentage points over the past 18 months, combined with expectations for increased quantities of Treasury debt over the coming quarter to plug bigger federal deficits has prompted investors to demand higher interest rates, eroding the value of notes and bonds sold at lower rates earlier in the year.“Treasury auction sizes will go up again — over the next couple of refundings in November and February — and if inflation doesn’t come back down, the market will need higher yields to absorb that supply,” said Michael Cudzil, portfolio manager at Pacific Investment Management Co. The Treasury’s quarterly refundings are when note and bond auction sizes are adjusted if necessary.The benchmark 10-year yield hovers around 4.2% after reaching 4.27% Tuesday, its highest level since October. The two-year note’s yield, which is more sensitive to changes in the Fed’s policy rate, is around 4.94%. It topped 5% Tuesday for the first time since July, when it peaked near 5.12%.Story continuesTraders are awaiting the release at 2 p.m. in Washington of the minutes of the Fed’s July meeting, when it raised the policy rate to 5.25%-5.5%. Swaps referencing future Fed meeting dates continue to anticipate rate cuts in 2024, however the amount of easing priced in has been reduced to about a percentage point.“The bond market is reacting more to what’s happening fundamentally,” said Kevin Flanagan, head of fixed income strategy at WisdomTree. “The Treasury market is finally getting on board with rates being higher for longer, and no recession.”Read more: US Ramps Up Debt Issuance, Adding Fuel to Selloff in TreasuriesThe Treasury index year-to-date return was negative from late February to early March as yields climbed in anticipation of a possible re-acceleration in the pace of Fed rate increases.

Text Content: * Venezuela rejects auction process that could lead to Citgo breakup * IMF in touch with Argentina presidential candidates -source * Latam FX up 0.2%, stocks add 0.8% By Bansari Mayur Kamdar Aug 16 (Reuters) - Most currencies in Latin America rose against the dollar on Wednesday, but Argentina's peso fell to a fresh historic low in the black market and the South American nation's stocks hit an all-time high amid growing political and economic uncertainty. The Argentine peso weakened to 765 per dollar in the popular parallel market, more than double the official rate of 350 fixed by the central bank on Monday until the October general elections. It was the third straight day of losses for the peso after far-right libertarian economist Javier Milei unexpectedly won a primary election over the weekend. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) reached out to the camps of Argentina presidential candidates Milei and Patricia Bullrich to coordinate meetings, a source close to the fund said on Tuesday. "Overall, following a 22% devaluation of the official exchange rate after the PASO election, we expect inflation expectations to drift further up in August and remain unanchored despite a broad set of controls across the economy," said Goldman Sachs' Sergio Armella in a note. "Weak policy credibility, a misaligned real exchange rate, critically low levels of international reserves, and elevated uncertainty are significant drivers of macroeconomic pressures." Argentina's leading stock index S&P Merval, often used as a hedge against inflation, hit a record high and was last up 4.7%. Broadly, stocks in Latin America gained 0.8%, outpacing the 0.6% slide in broader emerging market shares after Chinese stocks fell on fears of a sharper economic downturn. The MSCI's index for Latin American currencies added 0.2%, outpacing the 0.1% slip in the broader emerging market currencies index. Leading regional gains, the Chilean peso rose 1.0% against a weaker dollar, while Peru's sol advanced 0.7%. Oil exporter Mexico's peso gained 0.5% against the greenback, tracking firmer crude prices. With less than a month until the ruling party's presidential candidate is announced, former Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum has grown her lead to a 13-point advantage, a poll published on Wednesday in newspaper El Universal showed. The Brazilian real edged 0.2% up against the dollar. Brazil's average core inflation has been falling but it is still well above what policymakers would like, said central bank governor Roberto Campos Neto, reaffirming that the fight against inflation has not been won. Colombia's peso was on track for its fourth straight session of losses, last down 0.5%. Negotiators and officials representing Venezuela are opposing a court-ordered auction of shares in a parent of oil refiner Citgo Petroleum to pay creditors claiming more than $10 billion from expropriations and debt defaults. Elsewhere, Russia's rouble strengthened, one day after the central bank hiked interest rates to 12% at an emergency meeting and amid speculation over what other steps Russia may take to prop up its struggling currency.

Text Content: WASHINGTON (AP) — The White House is ramping up its efforts to illustrate the real-world impact of President Joe Biden’s signature climate, health care and tax law by showing how various Americans say they’ve benefited from his economic policies on the anniversary of the so-called Inflation Reduction Act.At a White House event Wednesday afternoon to celebrate a year since he signed the bill, Biden will stand alongside people — from union workers to small business owners to consumers — who the White House says have been aided by the law. That sweeping package, along with the bipartisan infrastructure law and a massive bill that bolsters production of semiconductor chips, make up the core of what the White House has branded “Bidenomics." It's aggressively promoting the concept as Biden seeks to improve his standing with voters amid his re-election campaign.Before the East Room event, the administration is rolling out a new online tool on invest.gov that relays stories from across the country about the impact of the president’s economic agenda.The White House is on a sprint to connect what they say is a popular economic agenda with an unpopular incumbent president, as polls show a majority of voters consistently disapprove of Biden’s handling of the economy even amid signs of a U.S. economic upswing.The inflation rate has cooled over the past year to a more manageable 3.2% annually, while job growth has stayed solid and the economy has avoided the recession that many analysts said would be needed to bring down prices. On Tuesday, the Census Bureau reported that retail sales have climbed 3.2% over the past 12 months.That level of consumer spending led the investment bank Goldman Sachs to raise its expectations for overall growth in the third quarter to an annual rate of 2.2%. The Atlanta Federal Reserve’s GDPNow estimate jumped even higher with the forecast of third-quarter growth reaching 5%.The evidence of economic strength has yet to translate into political gains for Biden, who has devoted the past several weeks to traveling the U.S. He's emphasized the roughly $500 billion worth of investments by private companies that have been spurred by his policies.Story continuesAides say the mood of the American electorate has been dampened in recent years by outside forces such as a once-in-a-century pandemic and the time it takes for laws signed by Biden to have an impact.“They’ll take time for people to feel,” Olivia Dalton, the principal White House deputy press secretary, said Tuesday as Biden traveled to Wisconsin. “But we believe we’re headed in the right direction and people are going to increasingly see that, and the president is going to keep talking about it.During his remarks Wednesday, Biden will lean into the climate provisions of the law, noting how the investments spurred by it have not only created jobs but given communities new resources to protect themselves from climate-related threats.U.S. Treasury is marking the legislation’s anniversary by releasing a new analysis that it says shows new clean energy investments spurred by the law are largely benefitting underserved communities.The agency report issued Wednesday states that new investments in clean energy, electric vehicles and batteries are concentrated in areas with lower employment, wages and college graduation rates.“Not only will these investments provide opportunity to communities that need it the most, but they will also leverage the most promising regions for national productivity growth,” said Treasury officials Eric Van Nostrand and Laura Feiveson in a Wednesday blog post.But the name is the Inflation Reduction Act after all, despite the minimal impact that the law has had in actually taming cost prices over the past year. So the administration is also rolling out a new report from the Department of Energy that shows the law will cut electricity rates up to 9 percent and lower gas prices by up to 13 percent by the year 2030.___Associated Press writers Josh Boak and Fatima Hussein contributed to this report.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- South Africa’s rolling blackouts have been blamed by strategists as the single biggest factor weighing on the rand. So, signs that the crisis is easing bode well for the currency.Prospects for gains in the rand in the next year or so are “really firm,” and much of this optimism is down to the outlook for electricity supply, according to Mamokete Lijane, global markets strategist at Standard Bank Corporate and Investment Banking.“If we continue to resolve that issue — even if it’s not whittled to zero, but we’ve brought it to a place where growth can be better — that would increase our competitiveness, boost our rand,” Lijane said at a Bloomberg event in Johannesburg Wednesday.South Africa’s state-run power company is unable to meet demand, subjecting the country to hours of scheduled daily blackouts that the central bank estimates may shave 2% off economic growth in 2023. Electricity Minister Kgosientsho Ramokgopa said this month that available generation capacity and unplanned breakdowns are improving at utility Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd.There’s some evidence that foreign investors are responding to the slightly better power supply. Between June 1 and Aug. 15, non-residents were net buyers of 34.4 billion rand ($1.8 billion) in local bonds, based on data from exchange operator JSE Ltd.During that period, blackouts reached so-called Stage six — when Eskom cuts 6,000 megawatts from the grid — only three times, according to data from ESP, a local app that provides updates and alerts on power cuts. That’s a turnaround from May where at least a third of the month was spent at that level.The currency gained 2.6% against the dollar in that time, though it’s still 11% weaker this year at about 19.15 to the greenback. The median of analyst forecasts compiled by Bloomberg sees the currency averaging 18 in the first quarter of 2024, about 6% stronger from where it is now.Story continuesRead more: South Africa’s Power Availability, Unplanned Loss ImprovesLonger-term, the rand’s fortunes rest on how soon South Africa can address structural challenges, said Lijane.“Looking through the noise, I’m quite constructive on the rand,” she said.--With assistance from Timothy Rangongo.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- While hedge funds were busy chasing the technology rally in the second quarter, there was one stock that most firms could agree they wanted out of: Intel Corp.More shares of the chipmaker were sold by the funds than any other company aside from mobile device maker Nokia Oyj, according to Bloomberg’s preliminary analysis of data from 13F filings. Steven Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management LP and David Tepper’s Appaloosa Management LP were among those that slashed positions.“If everyone is selling a stock, that says something,” said Jim Awad, senior managing director at Clearstead Advisors. “I favor the tech industry, but there are better ways to play it than Intel.”Intel has faced souring sentiment in the early stages of its turnaround plan, which hinges on reestablishing its once-bulletproof lead in chip technology. The termination of its $5.4 billion deal to acquire Tower Semiconductor Ltd. will be seen as a further setback, given it was once the keystone of Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger’s plan to get into a faster-growing part of the industry, the foundry market dominated by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.Read More: Intel Terminates Tower Deal After Failing to Get ApprovalsThe company has struggled to plant its flag in artificial intelligence computing, the subject of obsession for traders this year and currently dominated by rival Nvidia Corp. That stock saw hedge fund bets rise by $11.4 billion in the second quarter while Advanced Micro Devices Inc. saw a $1.5 billion increase, according to the 13F data. Funds cut their Intel stakes by nearly half, with sellers outnumbering buyers two to one.Story continuesIntel offered signs of progress in its turnaround effort last month when it revealed a surprise profit in the second quarter and promised to show more evidence of its long-awaited comeback in the second half of the year. So far this quarter, the stock’s 4% gain is the second-best performance in the Philadelphia semiconductor index.In the context of the full year, however, the stock still lags far behind other chipmakers. The longer Intel’s turnaround takes, the more inclined investors will be to look elsewhere, according to Clearstead’s Awad.“It is trying to come up with more competitive products, but that will take time,” said Awad. “In the meantime there are better positioned companies.”This story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.Tech Chart of the DayAs the rally in technology stocks cools in August, the Nasdaq 100 Index is inching closer to the lower-end of this year’s uptrend channel.

Text Content: By Allison LampertAug 16 (Reuters) - Loss-making private jet firm Wheels Up Experience nabbed a key $500 million lifeline but still faces turnaround challenges, as demand for private travel softens in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and rival operators lure some of their customers.Wheels Up avoided a possible bankruptcy when it secured backing from investors on Tuesday, including U.S. carrier Delta Air Lines. Shares rose 11% on Wednesday in midday trading.But the company still has work to do to become profitable in a more difficult environment, said business aviation consultant Brian Foley. Two operators have closed down since May in the face of diminished traffic and higher labor costs could force some private-jet operators out of business."There will be some more casualties," Foley said.Rivals, meanwhile, say they have been picking up some of the company's customers."I don't wish for turmoil in the market at all, but I'm an opportunist," said Jim Segrave, CEO of private operator FlyExclusive, who said his company has attracted customers from Wheels Up, the third-largest private-flight operator last year.Wheels Up said it is pleased with the response from customers. "We are in the middle of year-long meaningful improvement in our operational performance and service levels," the company said in a statement.Wheels Up, which charters planes by the hour, went public in 2021 through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) with the goal of appealing to a broader flying base as an "Uber of the sky."The state of private traffic and the preowned plane market are both closely watched by investors as they affect demand for corporate jets from companies like General Dynamics's Gulfstream and Canada's Bombardier.While private flying remains above 2019 levels, traffic has slowed since the pandemic, when wealthy passengers sought to avoid crowded commercial airports. Charter traffic from the top 10 U.S. private airports declined 17% on an annual basis for the first half of 2023, research firm Argus International said.Story continues"The demand we saw at the end of 2021 and 2022 would have been difficult to sustain," said Travis Kuhn, a senior vice president at Argus.A one-way, last-minute flight from New York to Miami on a light business jet which seats six to eight passengers would cost around $20,000, compared with a first class ticket at roughly $1,100 per passenger, according to Justin Crabbe, chief executive at private-flight platform Jettly.Higher salariesfor North American airline pilots also are putting pressure on private aviation to raise wages."It will challenge some of the players that lack experience," said Andrew Collins, co-CEO of private aviation operator FlexJet.However, experienced rivals with deeper pockets are expected to still attract flyers.Segrave, of North Carolina-based FlyExclusive, said in an interview he sees opportunity to gain market share in a softer market as it prepares to go public through a SPAC. The company, which provided third-party flying service to Wheels Up, faces a lawsuit from Wheels Up over a contract dispute.Jamie Walker, chairman of U.S. private jet operator Jet Linx, said he sees opportunity for both organic growth and acquisitions due to the softening marketplace. The company has attracted new customers due to Wheels Up's recent struggles."We have received numerous inquiries over the last several months from Wheels Up clients who are unsettled with the financial health of the company," Walker said. "But more importantly, we have successfully converted many of them." (Reporting By Allison Lampert in Montreal, editing by Ben Klayman and Andy Sullivan)

Text Content: WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of former senior U.S. national security officials urged Congress on Wednesday to dedicate resources to President Joe Biden's recent order restricting some outbound U.S. investment to China, calling it a top priority.Twenty-one veteran officials – including former deputy national security advisor during the Trump administration Matt Pottinger, and Colin Kahl, who stepped down in July as undersecretary of defense for policy – sent a letter to congressional leaders, calling the order "a positive step in the overdue process of limiting adversaries' access to American capital.""The United States must ensure that [China] and other foreign adversaries aren't able to use our financial dynamism and openness against us in ways that continue to threaten our national security and prosperity," they wrote in the letter seen by Reuters, sent to Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy.The further development of outbound investment transparency and review should be "among your top foreign policy priorities", they wrote, calling it essential that Congress commit resources to implementation.Biden's order, issued last week but expected to be implemented next year, is aimed at preventing American capital and expertise from helping China develop technologies that could support its military modernization and undermine U.S. national security.It authorizes the U.S. Treasury secretary to prohibit or restrict U.S. investments in Chinese entities in three sectors: semiconductors and microelectronics, quantum information technologies and certain artificial intelligence systems.Peter Harrell, a former Biden National Security Council official, and former commanders of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command Harry Harris and Philip Davidson, were among the other officials who endorsed the letter.China has said it is "gravely concerned" by the order, though some U.S. lawmakers have criticized it as having too many loopholes.(Reporting by Michael Martina; Editing by Sharon Singleton)

Text Content: By Dawit EndeshawADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Safaricom's M-Pesa mobile money service went live in Ethiopia on Wednesday, in a boost to the Kenyan telecoms operator as it seeks to kickstart growth in one of Africa's biggest economies.Safaricom, which is part owned by South Africa’s Vodacom and Britain’s Vodafone, launched its voice and data network in the Horn of Africa country last year and has signed up more than 2 million active users.Safaricom introduced M-Pesa in Kenya in 2007. The service has grown to become the company's biggest moneymaker and is also offered in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Mozambique and Tanzania."M-Pesa is known to be a game-changer for financial inclusion," said Stanley Njoroge, Safaricom Ethiopia's interim CEO. "We will continue to broaden the services our customers receive from the M-Pesa platform."Safaricom became the first private telecoms provider in Ethiopia after the government in 2019 liberalised a sector that had long been dominated by the state-controlled Ethio Telecom.The company is betting that Ethiopia, which has around 120 million people and one of Africa's youngest populations, will power growth for years to come.Analysts said the market offers enormous opportunities, but also requires huge investments that will put Safaricom under pressure to deliver quick results.Safaricom's core earnings fell by a fifth in the year to March 31, hit by the cost of starting operations in Ethiopia.The company also faces stiff competition from Ethio Telecom, whose profits more than doubled in its latest financial year. In July, Ethio Telecom reported having more than 34 million subscribers to its mobile money service Telebirr.Mobile money services are common in East Africa, allowing customers to send and receive money and pay for goods and services.(Reporting by Dawit Endeshaw; editing by Elias Biryabarema, Aaron Ross and Jane Merriman)

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- The blank-check company seeking to take Donald Trump’s media company public sweetened the proposed deal to keep the former president from walking away. Now it needs to make sure rank—and-file investors stick around, too.Digital World Acquisition Corp., the special-purpose acquisition company that’s been waiting to take over Trump Media & Technology Group for nearly two years, will ask investors on Thursday to push out the deadline for closing the deal by another 12 months. That would be the fifth such extension and potentially give it the time needed to surmount the remaining legal hurdles to buying Trump’s company, whose main asset is Truth Social, the Twitter look-a-like he uses to communicate with followers.As it stands, the SPAC must complete a deal by Sept. 8 or risk returning its roughly $300 million to investors. Such an unwinding would be costly to stockholders: The SPAC shares are trading for some 60% more than the $10.24 investors will get back if the merger collapses.The high premium reflects the rally since last month on optimism the deal will finally get done after Digital World reached a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission and revamped the structure of the deal to help ensure Trump stays committed to it. The changes included those that would benefit Trump himself, including the creation of a new class of shares to be issued to the company’s principal.“With Trump involved you would expect controversy and all sorts of twists and turns, so DWAC has not disappointed,” said Matthew Tuttle, chief executive of Tuttle Capital Management. He’s never seen a SPAC dole out super-voting shares this late in the game, but said that “it’s Trump, so expect the unexpected.”Story continuesRead more: Trump-Tied SPAC Climbs as Merger Partners Extend Pact Timing (1)Yet the SPAC closing remains far from certain. The reworked deal allows Trump Media to walk away by Sept. 30 if its board decides the merger isn’t in investors’ best interest or by Oct. 13 if Digital World doesn’t file an amended registration statement by Oct. 9. Digital World also has similar powers to break it off.Another pressing issue for Digital World: in May it said it will need to restate its 2022 financial results after accounting errors were discovered. It’s former auditor, Marcum LLP resigned, citing the SEC charges. The SPAC, which has since hired Adeptus Partners LLC, was also warned by Nasdaq that its shares could be delisted for delays in filing its financial reports.The Thursday vote would extend Digital World’s lifeline for another year, though the SPAC can push back the vote by days or weeks to corral enough traders. Last year the company had to delay the vote a handful of times as it hounded the individual-investor crowd to approve the proposals.But for the SPAC’s shareholders, Trump Media’s commitment to the deal until the end of the year was a strongly positive move forward, said Usha Rodrigues, a professor of corporate law at the University of Georgia School of Law.“However, the SPAC will still need to get investor buy in to extend the SPAC,” she said, “which isn’t guaranteed.”©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: Discount grocer Aldi said Wednesday it plans to buy 400 Winn-Dixie and Harveys supermarkets in the southern U.S.Under a proposed merger agreement, Aldi will acquire all outstanding shares of Jacksonville, Florida-based Southeastern Grocers Inc., the parent company of Winn-Dixie and Harveys. If the deal is approved by regulators, it's expected to close in the first half of 2024.Financial terms of the deal weren’t disclosed. Both Southeastern Grocers and Aldi are private companies. Aldi is based in Germany with a U.S. headquarters in Batavia, Illinois.Aldi said the deal supports its long-term growth strategy in the U.S., where it expects to have 2,400 stores by the end of this year. The Winn-Dixie and Harveys supermarkets it’s acquiring are primarily in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana and Mississippi.Aldi said it will convert some locations to its own brand and format, which cuts costs with features like lean inventories and self-bagging. But it will operate some stores under the Winn-Dixie and Harveys brands.The deal comes amid wider consolidation in the grocery industry as customers increasingly defect to big box stores like Walmart, which controls more than 20% of U.S. grocery sales. Last fall, Kroger and Albertsons __ two of the largest U.S. grocery chains __ announced plans to merge in a $20 billion deal. Regulators are reviewing that plan now; if it’s approved, it is expected to close early next year.Southeastern Grocers also plans to sell its 28 Fresco y Mas stores to Fresco Retail Group, an investment company, which will continue to operate them under the same brand.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Latin American startups are increasingly taking on high-interest loans as venture capitalists pull back on equity investments in the region.Debt represented about one-third of all venture capital raised in the first half, the highest proportion on record, according to data from Lavca, a nonprofit association for private capital investment in Latin America.Startups are “rolling out the red carpet” for lenders, said Gabriel Carbonelli, a money manager for venture debt at Riza Asset Management in Sao Paulo, which loaned 70 million reais (about $14 million) in the past year. “In the prior years, we had to actively go out and explain all the details to companies. Now, they are coming to us.”The increase in borrowing reflects how desperate founders have become for cash and how reticent they are to accept equity deals that would drastically reduce valuations their companies received when money flowed freely and interest rates were low. It marks a dramatic shift for an industry that had just started to flourish, producing dozens of billion dollar companies — known in the startup world as unicorns — and catching the attention of global investors, such as SoftBank Group Corp, that built dedicated funds for the region.Venture spending has declined globally as policymakers raised interest rates, but the impact has been acute in Latin America’s relatively young startup scene.While venture debt has been widely used in other markets, it was largely unseen in Latin America until equity investors started to shy from writing big checks. In the 12 months ending June 30, startups borrowed about $1 billion, often at interest rates in the low teens. Equity investments in the region fell to around $3 billion in that same period, after dropping steadily since a late 2021 peak, according to Lavca’s data.Story continues“Startups need cash,” said Freddie Goudie, a Miami-based partner and business lawyer at Foley Lardner, which has worked on debt deals. “The sources of funding are drying up.”The alternative, he said, is not to get the capital and closing their doors within 12 months.Read more: Credit Card Rates Reach 790% in a Once-Hot Fintech MarketDue to a lack of options, companies are being forced to accept terms and conditions such as minimum return guarantees, make-wholes and equity kickers — on top of high interest payments, Goudie said.“We are talking about companies that have good ideas, but don’t have proved business models,” said Felipe Barreto, a Sao Paulo-based private equity lawyer at Candido Martins. “So investors ask for collateral that is quite elevated. You can bankrupt your own company if your accounts are not balanced.”Such an environment heightens the difference between startups that are struggling to gain foothold and those that have established a thriving business model, according to Marcos Kantt, chief financial officer at Habi, a Colombian online residential real estate platform that gained unicorn status in 2022.Habi raised about $300 million in debt lines over the last 12 months at very low rates, allowing it to grow without diluting shareholders further, Kantt said.“Not everybody’s going to debt because that’s their last chance at surviving” he added. “A lot of us are going to debt because it’s the best thing to do for the business and our stakeholders.”Miami-based HCS Capital CEO Alex Horvitz said his tech fund has completed $10 million of venture debt deals in the last nine months and zero new equity investment in Latin America. In the nine months prior, the fund had deployed around $20 million in equity and no venture debt.HCS, which invests in health care, insurance and financial startup companies globally, is charging between 12% and 16% in interest, roughly in line with benchmark rates in the region.“It was very rare, you would not come across any debt opportunities,” Horvitz said. “We started doing venture debt just two years ago and now 25% to 30% of our capital is venture debt.”--With assistance from Michael O'Boyle.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Production at U.S. factories unexpectedly rebounded in July as motor vehicle output surged, but activity continues to be hamstrung by higher borrowing costs.Manufacturing output increased 0.5% last month, the Federal Reserve said on Wednesday. Data for June was revised lower to show production at factories falling 0.5% instead of 0.3% as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory output would be unchanged.Production dropped 0.7% on a year-on-year basis in July. Since March 2022, the Federal Reserve has raised its benchmark overnight interest rate by 525 basis points to the current 5.25%-5.50% range. That has pressured manufacturing, which accounts for 11.1% of the economy.There are, however, tentative signs that manufacturing could be stabilizing. While the Institute for Supply Management's measure of national factory activity contracted for the 7th straight month in July, the pace slowed, with the ISM noting that "customers' inventory levels are at the proper tension ... a potential slight positive for future production."Demand for goods also continues to hold up.Motor vehicle and parts output accelerated 5.2% last month after declining 3.9% in June. The jump likely reflected difficulties adjusting the data for seasonal fluctuations.Production typically falls in July when automakers idle plants for retooling. The temporary plant closures, however, do not always happen, which could throw off the model that the Fed uses to strip out seasonal fluctuations from the data.Outside motor vehicles, durable manufacturing recorded increases in output of machinery as well as computer and electronic products. But production of electrical equipment, appliances and components declined as did that of primary metals, furniture and related products.In nondurable manufacturing, there were modest decreases in the production of paper, plastics and rubber products as well as apparel and leather.Story continuesMining output increased 0.5% after dropping 0.9% in June. Utilities production soared 5.4%, rebounding after three straight monthly declines as heat-wave across many parts of the country increased demand for air conditioning.Overall industrial production shot up 1.0% in July after dropping 0.8% in June.Capacity utilization for the industrial sector, a measure of how fully firms are using their resources, increased to 79.3% in July from 78.6% in June. It is 0.4 percentage point below its 1972–2022 average. The operating rate for the manufacturing sector rose to 77.8% last month from 77.5% in June and is 0.4 percentage point below its long-run average.(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Doctors transplanted a pig’s kidney into a brain-dead man’s body where it continued to function normally, moving the field closer to the possibility of using animal tissue and organs to fight human disease.The man in his 50s had acute kidney injury and a history of end-stage disease, but his organs produced urine soon after the transplant, according researchers at NYU Langone Health in New York. The transplant was done more than a month ago, and the kidney continues to function, they said Wednesday in a call with reporters.The successful transplant is the latest breakthrough for scientists racing to find alternatives to human organs that are in constant shortage. Nearly 40 million people in the US have chronic kidney disease, and 17 people die each day in the US waiting for an organ transplant, according to the National Kidney Foundation.The experimental procedure, called a xenotransplant, marks “another major step forward in potentially utilizing an alternative supply of organs for people facing life-threatening disease,” according to a statement from the medical center. The pig’s organ underwent genetic modification to make it more acceptable to the host body.Read More: Pig Organs Revived After Death Offer Transplant Patients HopeResearchers have looked at a variety of ways to use animal organs and tissues in humans, including reviving those obtained from deceased animals. The key sticking point has been maintaining their health in the human body, where they’re under consistent attack from an immune system that targets “non-self” cells, proteins and tissues, a process called rejection.Story continuesIn the experiment with the modified pig organ, “there’s no evidence of rejection in normal renal function and clearance of toxins,” Robert Montgomery, who led the NYU team, said on the call. “The pig kidney appears to replace all the important tasks that the human kidney manages.”If the organ continues functioning for two months, it will have surpassed the time when most comparable xenotransplants in monkeys have failed, said Montgomery, who is chairman of Langone’s surgery department and director of its Transplant Institute.“It’s extremely complicated but at the end of the day we have to think about all the people who are dying because we don’t have enough organs,” Montgomery said. “We’re getting close to having that preponderance of evidence” to move into experiments with living humans, he said.(Updates with comments from press call)©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- For months on end, Wall Street banks were stuck holding $5.4 billion of debt for Apollo Global Management Inc.’s leveraged buyout of Tenneco Inc. as the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes rattled credit markets — and would-be buyers disappeared.The firms were forced to hold the debt for so long, in fact, that they wound up with a small silver lining: interest payments that were large enough to cover most of the losses that piled up as markets moved against them and their capital remained locked in limbo.On Tuesday, markets thawed enough to finally allow the group of more than a dozen banks led by Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp. to sell off over half of the debt that financed the Tenneco acquisition. The $1.2 billion leveraged loan and $1.9 billion of junk bonds were sold to investors for just 85 cents on the dollar, saddling the banks with losses of more than $270 million, after factoring in fees and the pricing flexibility provided for underwriting the deal.But the time the debt stayed on their books also allowed the banks to benefit from high interest rates. In the roughly nine months since the private equity firm closed the purchase of the auto-parts maker, they received around $210 million in interest payments, offsetting most of the hit, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg and market participants familiar with the deal.The Tenneco sale is the latest example of how investment banks are chipping away at the more than $40 billion pile of such debt they were left holding when the Fed brought an abrupt end to the near-zero rates of the pandemic. The financing was among the biggest of those stranded deals, outstripped by only a couple of others, such as the $12.5 billion financing for Elon Musk’s purchase of Twitter Inc., now known as X.Story continuesWith investors now wagering that the central bank is done tightening monetary policy and the economy proving surprisingly resilient, banks are again able to offload chunks of the acquisition-related debt to institutional money managers. It’s another sign of business-as-usual returning to corners of the US credit markets.The outcome, of course, doesn’t make up for separate costs, including the inability to make other loans as banks’ capital was tied up for so long. And they still haven’t offloaded all of the Tenneco debt, nor is it clear when they will be able to do so. Moreover, the actual losses on Tuesday’s sale could exceed the estimates, depending on the exact size of the interest payments and other details that aren’t public.Representatives for Citi, Bank of America, and Apollo declined to comment. Representatives for Tenneco did not respond to a request for comment.Yet the sale marks one step toward concluding a long saga for banks stuck with the Tenneco debt.Apollo announced the acquisition in February 2022, just before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine unsettled global markets. The Fed started raising interest rates the following month, initiating the aggressive monetary policy tightening that has pushed its benchmark rate from near zero to the current range of 5.25% to 5.5%.As is typical with such takeovers, banks committed to lend the money with the intention of selling the debt to investors before the deal closed. But by November, when Apollo completed the acquisition, debt buyers had grown scarce as the corporate junk-bond market headed toward the worst annual losses since the 2008 credit crisis and leveraged-loan prices remained depressed. As a result, the banks had to provide the cash themselves.The scale of that selloff meant that the price of the bonds and loans would have to be cut to account for the surge in interest rates. That shifted risk to the banks, which agree to cap companies’ borrowing costs based on market levels at the time such a financing is struck. When the Tenneco deal was announced, junk bonds were yielding around 5.7%. It’s around 8.5% now.Even after Tuesday’s sale, though, the banks are still holding a $1.3 billion term loan A and $1 billion of unsecured bonds related to Apollo’s buyout of Tenneco.Those have generated around $180 million of additional interest for the first three-fourths of this year, according to Bloomberg’s estimates. But if the banks try to eventually sell the unsecured debt, which is considered riskier because it is not backed by specific assets, they will likely have to do so at a steeper discount than Tuesday’s transaction, unless the market’s tone improves significantly.Banks are also contending with two other large buyout-debt deals they’ve yet to sell. In addition to the Twitter obligations, a group led by Barclays Plc and Bank of America holds around $5 billion of debt committed for another Apollo transaction — the acquisition of broadband and telecommunications company Brightspeed.--With assistance from Lisa Lee and Michael Tobin.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: Homebuilders stepped up new construction last month amid persistent inventory shortages, but they weren't as bullish on future developments.Housing starts for both new single- and multi-family units increased to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.452 million units, according to the Census Bureau data out Wednesday. That’s 3.9% higher than June’s revised estimate rate of 1.398 million units and 5.9% higher from a year ago. That pace just exceeded the 1.450 million units economists surveyed by Bloomberg projected.Permits to build came in at an annualized rate of 1.442 million units in July, just a 0.1% gain from the revised June rate of 1.441 million units and lower than economists' expectations of 1.463 million units. Single-family dwellings permits rose 0.6% from the month prior to 924,000 units. On the multi-family side, the pace delivered a rate of 464,000 units in July.For much of the year, homebuilders have been optimistic as a limited supply of previously owned homes sparked more interest in new construction. But with mortgage rates now hovering near 7%, consumers are again feeling the pinch of affordability and builders have noticed. The latest builder sentiment dipped for the first time in August, after seven consecutive months of increases."Rising mortgage rates and high construction costs stemming from a dearth of construction workers, a lack of buildable lots and ongoing shortages of distribution transformers put a chill on builder sentiment in August," Alicia Huey, NAHB chairman and a homebuilder from Birmingham, Ala., said in a statement on Tuesday.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.New construction has been a key source of housing inventory as homes on the for-sale side remain near historic lows. Many homeowners are reluctant to sell and lose their low mortgage rate for one that is twice as high.As a result, many homebuilders have started to refocus their attention on first-time homebuyers, who are making up a larger share of their buyer pool. Builders are offering mortgage rate buy-downs to make financing more affordable, while others are shrinking the size of the homes they build.Story continuesFor example, LGI Homes (LGIH) reported in its second quarter earnings ending June 30 that “the percentage of closings coming from homes smaller than 1,500 square feet went from 19% in the second quarter of last year to 27% in the quarter just completed,” per Eric Thomas Lipar, CEO.But LGI Homes isn’t the only one employing these tools from their toolbox. Nationally, the trend is holding ground.Data gathered from the Census Quarterly Starts and Completions by Purpose and Design and NAHB analysis shows the average square footage of a new home stood at 2,469 square feet in the first quarter of 2023. That’s a 2.2% drop from the previous six quarters when the square footage averaged 2,525 square feet.(Getty Images)“It’s all about solving for affordability,” Eric Finnigan, vice president, research and demographics at John Burns Research & Consulting, told Yahoo Finance. “Builders are reducing the square footage of their homes as one way to keep costs down and their homes affordable.”While home sizes have steadily gone down, the price of one has not. There are several factors impacting this including the increased costs to build. The average price per square foot of new houses has climbed over the past decade, advancing more than 95% nationally, LendingTree reported.“Increased raw material costs and labor scarcity issues during the pandemic made it considerably more expensive and challenging for builders to construct homes. As the cost of building rose, so did the costs passed on to homebuyers,” Jacob Channel, senior economist at LendingTree, wrote.“It’s clear that building a home is often anything but cheap, and that finding a place to construct a large house can be challenging,” Channel added.—Dani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Text Content: (Reuters) -Visa is under fresh investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice over allegations it is charging retailers more for not using the payment firm's proprietary tokenization technology, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter.The DOJ's antitrust probe against Visa, which began in early 2021, is investigating if the company uses anticompetitive practices in the debit card market.The tokenization technology, launched by Visa in 2014, swaps debit card numbers with tokens that can exclusively be used on a particular device or with a merchant, replacing users' sensitive account information with a unique digital identifier, the report said.The DOJ declined to comment and Visa did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.Both Visa and rival Mastercard are facing increasing scrutiny for their dominance in the payments market.The U.S. Federal Trade Commission started an investigation last October into whether Visa and Mastercard's security tokens restrict debit-card routing in online payments.Visa disclosed last month that the DOJ's antitrust division had on May 2 demanded additional documents and information on its debit card practices in the United States and competition with other payment networks.Mastercard also disclosed in April that it was being asked to provide additional information by the DOJ.In 2019, Visa had settled a European Union antitrust probe relating to card fees.(Reporting by Pritam Biswas in Bengaluru; Editing by Pooja Desai)

The Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.3%.The tepid open came after declines in European and Asian stock markets. The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 45 nations, was down 0.27%."Much of the decline is explained by continuing concerns surrounding the economic slowdown in China, as well as rising tensions with the U.S.," said Thomas Gehlen, senior market strategist at Kleinwort Hambros.China's new home prices fell for the first time this year in July, data showed on Wednesday.The Chinese central bank lowered its policy rate on Tuesday, after a long run of weak figures, but investors have so far been unimpressed by the response.News that a leading Chinese trust firm has missed repayments on dozens of investment products since late last month added to fears the country's property crisis would have a wider impact.In currency markets, sterling picked up after data showed that Britain's inflation fell in July but the core measure came in slightly higher than expected. It was last up 0.39% at $1.275.The dollar index, which measures the currency against six major peers, was down 0.1% at 103.14, ending a run of four straight daily increases.Investors have bought the safe-haven dollar on the back of strong U.S. economic data and rising concerns about China.Markets will get a sense of the Fed's thinking on interest rates at 1800 GMT (2 p.m. ET), when the minutes from July's decision are released. The Fed raised rates by 25 basis points to a 5.25% to 5.5% range at the meeting.Story continuesAccording to pricing in derivatives markets, traders think the Fed has probably finished raising rates."While the Fed prefers to retain optionality given lingering uncertainties about the macro outlook, we continue to believe that July's was the last rate hike of the tightening cycle. In effect, we expect the minutes to reflect policy discussions among Fed officials are already entertaining the possibility of pausing going forward," said TD Securities analysts in a note.The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note was at 4.199% on Wednesday, after hitting a more than nine-month high of 4.274% in the previous session.U.S. crude oil and Brent crude both rebounded slightly after a Tuesday selloff, climbing 0.16% and 0.1%, respectively.(Reporting by Harry Robertson in London and Pete Schroeder in Washington, additional reporting by Kane Wu in Hong Kong; Editing by Barbara Lewis and Mark Potter)

Text Content: By Max A. Cherney(Reuters) - A scientist at Harvard used Google's cloud platform to clone a supercomputer for a heart disease study, in a novel move that other researchers could follow to get around a shortage of powerful computing resources and speed up their work.The study simulated a therapy that aims to dissolve blood clots and tumor cells in the human circulatory system that required an enormous amount of computing power that typically can be harnessed with a supercomputer, according to Harvard professor Petros Koumoutsakos."The big problem that we had (was) we could run one simulation using a full scale supercomputer," Koumoutsakos said, adding that refining or optimizing the simulation required further access to the supercomputer.In the U.S., there are only a handful of supercomputers that are capable of running the billions of calculations to accurately mimic the conditions in Koumoutsakos's study.The small number of machines capable of performing the research has created bottlenecks in the scientific process, according to Citadel Securities research platform head Costas Bekas.To eliminate the bottlenecks researchers and companies such as Citadel that need an enormous amount of computing resources only found in supercomputers have begun to turn to the public cloud.But cloud computing operations aren't designed to handle the demands researchers have. They are designed for millions of individual, relatively small computing tasks - things such as streaming video, serving webpages or database access. The cloud is usually built for reliability and resilience."Folks are realizing the potential for cloud to solve problems and technical scientific engineering computing to really unlock productivity and get to better answers, better insights, faster," said Bill Magro chief high performance computing technologist at Google Cloud.Modifying cloud infrastructure to behave like a supercomputer requires changes in the software, networking and physical design of the hardware, Magro said.Citadel helped sponsor Koumoutsakos's research with Alphabet Inc subsidiary Google.(Reporting by Max A.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Fitch Ratings Ltd. said it may reconsider China’s A+ sovereign credit score, adding to the growing pessimism toward the nation’s financial markets.If China extends its balance sheet to support the economy, “we might think again, because the debt-to-GDP ratio is a little bit on the high side for a single ‘A’ credit,” James McCormack, global head of sovereigns, told Bloomberg TV. “I wouldn’t say we’re expecting that, certainly recent evidence doesn’t suggest that would be the case,” but an increase in debt in the corporate and banking sector could become “real liabilities for the government.”China’s A+ stable rating is one of Fitch’s longest-standing, in place since 2007, according to McCormack. “The factors that would move it is if there were some kind of increase,” in contingent liabilities in other sectors, he said.McCormack’s comments come with Fitch’s downgrade of the US credit rating earlier this month still reverberating round global markets. That reignited a conversation about the US government’s fiscal path and its impact on Treasuries and helped play a role in the recent rise in yields.Over in China, global investors are rapidly losing their patience in the country’s fragile recovery, with recent economic data from retail sales to home prices disappointing. Making the matter worse, one of country’s largest property developers is at risk of default and a financial conglomerate missed payments on investment products, stoking fears about possible contagion.There is a structural change underway in China’s property market, McCormack said.A large injection of short-term cash to China’s financial system on Wednesday and central bank interest-rate cuts on Tuesday have failed to restore optimism. The onshore yuan is falling toward its weakest level in 16 years against the dollar, and the MSCI China Index of stocks is poised to erase gains seen since a key policy meeting in late July.Story continues--With assistance from David Ingles, Joanne Wong, Ruth Carson and Tom Hancock.(Updates with additional context)©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

A woman who was with him was injured and was taken to an emergency hospital with a gunshot wound.Pre-trial proceedings have been initiated and police are examining the crime scene.Petrov, 61, was the target of at least two other attempts on his life.A karate champion and former state security agent, Petrov left his job in the police after the fall of communism to start a private business. It boomed, and he became an associate in over 50 companies by 2002.In 2010, he was arrested and charged with running a criminal group engaged in extortion, racketeering, drug trafficking, money laundering, and tax evasion.He was released on bail and eventually acquitted, while the next year he was even a candidate in the presidential election.In recent years, Petrov ran one of the biggest insurance companies in the country. He also served as an adviser to the head of the State Agency for National Security, and for some time was also a university lecturer in economics,During the 1990s, killings of public figures were a common occurrence in Bulgaria, but the new outburst of violence has shocked the country.

Though the activist investor has since backed off — this week revealing that it had dissolved its stake in PayPal altogether — the damage has been done, and the concerns that Elliott raised, especially surrounding margins, still remain.And so far this year, PayPal stock has declined more than 16% despite a broader tech rally.Here are the top three challenges that Chriss will face when he takes the helm at PayPal on September 27.Good growth is hard to findThough PayPal has often succeeded in finding growth, it hasn't always been the growth that investors were hoping for.Take PayPal's second quarter, for example. The company saw 11% total payment volume growth, 7% revenue growth, and 8% growth within branded checkout. However, the gross profit numbers didn't follow, coming in at a mere 1% growth. The company also missed on its adjusted operating margin of 21.4%, given Wall Street's estimate of 22%.These concerns about PayPal's ability to grow while optimizing its margins have kept many analysts cautious at best."We remain on the sidelines and await greater confidence in PayPal’s growth algorithm as we see concerns in the longer-term EPS growth profile," John Davis of Raymond James wrote on August 2.Intuit executive Alex Chriss will become the president and CEO of digital payments company PayPal in September 2023. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File)Competition from Apple and Square has heated upPayPal has long benefited from being one of the first-ever fintechs, weaving together tech and financial services way before it was a well-trodden path.However, products from Square's parent company Block (SQ) and Apple (AAPL) have been gaining ground at a rapid clip, a process of adoption that shows no signs of slowing.A 2023 Deutsche Bank survey, based on responses from 1,708 consumers, showed that PayPal has retained its dominance, but its lead is fragile as adoption rates shoot up for Apple Pay and Block's Cash App.Story continues"While PYPL continues to be the dominant mobile payment service with 71% of respondents having used the service in the past 12 months, Cash App and Apple Pay both saw large increases in adoption over the past year reaching 46% and 31% adoption, respectively, up from 31% and 23%, respectively, last year," Deutsche Bank analyst Bryan Keane wrote in April.Big shoes to fillChriss — who was at Intuit for almost two decades — will be coming into PayPal as an outsider, and that will present challenges."Coming from the outside, whatever your credentials or accomplishments, you are going to face fear-based skepticism," Peerage Capital founder and entrepreneur Miles Nadal said. "No matter how urgent the need for change, people fear it. That’s further amplified by an outside appointment that sends the signal there is an appetite for change at the highest levels of the organization."Furthermore, Chriss will be stepping in for Schulman, a notable figure in his own right. Even before PayPal, Schulman made his mark as the founding CEO of Virgin Mobile, a formative CEO of Priceline, and a key executive at American Express.President of PayPal Dan Schulman looks on at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) headquarters in Washington, DC, on April 14, 2023. (Photo by Stefani Reynolds / AFP via Getty Images)In some ways, this is almost the equivalent of a new CEO taking on the job of a tech CEO-founder, as Schulman has become indelibly associated with PayPal. Schulman stepped in at PayPal in 2014, as the company was separating from eBay (EBAY), and has been PayPal's CEO for the entirety of its tenure as a public company.But PayPal (and its shareholders and activists) have spoken, and it's time for PayPal to head in a new direction.Chriss's first task on September 27 will be gaining trust — something that could be more complicated than filling Schulman's shoes or getting margins in order."The first challenge is demonstrating the credibility, purpose, and the clear direction required to win internal and external stakeholder trust," said Nadal. "That trust then translates into support."Allie Garfinkle is a Senior Tech Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Text Content: (Adds background, details of results in paragraphs 3-7)Aug 16 (Reuters) - Cisco Systems projected annual revenue below market estimates on Wednesday, in a sign that an uncertain economic outlook was weighing on demand at one of the biggest makers of networking equipment.Slowing cloud demand has in recent quarters muddied the outlook for suppliers of hardware such as switches and routers, which power computer networks and the internet. Rival Juniper Networks also offered a weak forecast last month.Cisco expects full-year revenue to be between $57 billion and $58.20 billion, compared with analysts' average estimate of $58.38 billion, according to Refinitiv data.The company has also tried to reduce its dependence on one-time sales of expensive hardware by pushing more of its software services, which are more lucrative as they bring in recurring payments.It forecast annual adjusted earnings per share of $4.01 to $4.08, compared with analysts' estimate of $4.04.Shares of the California-based company fell more than 2% in extended trading. The stock has risen nearly 12% so far this year, but lagged the wider, AI-fueled rally in the U.S. market.Cisco, which supplies to companies such as telecom firm AT&T and auto retailer AutoNation, reported fourth-quarter revenue of $15.20 billion, compared with analysts' estimate of $15.05 billion.(Reporting by Zaheer Kachwala in Bengaluru; Editing by Shilpi Majumdar)

Text Content: JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — A California-based company will pay just under $5 million in fines for discharging wastewater into a publicly owned sewage treatment plant in Mississippi without obtaining a valid state permit, a federal judge ruled Tuesday.View Inc., a glass-making firm headquartered in Silicon Valley, previously pleaded guilty to negligently discharging wastewater into a city sewer system from the company's sole manufacturing facility in Olive Branch, Mississippi. That discharge endangered residents in the north Mississippi community and Memphis suburb of almost 40,000, federal prosecutors said.“When companies place profit and convenience above public safety, we will do all we can to punish that behavior and protect the public,” U.S. Attorney Clay Joyner said in a news release. “This illegal discharge of wastewater into the public treatment facility demonstrated a blatant disregard for the safety and wellbeing of citizens in our District."In addition to the fines, U.S. District Judge Sharion Aycock sentenced the company to a three-year term of probation.The company discharges about 248,000 gallons of wastewater per day from glass-cutting, grinding, washing and polishing directly into the city’s sewer system. But the company did so without a proper permit for years, prosecutors said.“Unpermitted discharges of industrial wastewater can pose a serious threat to our nation’s wastewater treatment systems,” said Charles Carfagno, a special agent with the Environmental Protection Agency.The company did not answer a call to its general line and did not immediately respond to a written request for comment.The Mississippi glass plant opened by View Inc. was initially touted as a successful economic development project by former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour. In 2010, Barbour lured the company, previously known as Soladigm, to the state with a $40 million loan, according to The Commercial Appeal.According to its website, the company makes “smart windows” that can lower energy costs and improve mental health. In July, the company reached a settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for failing to disclose $28 million in liabilities to address a defect in its windows. In a news release, the agency said it decided not to impose civil penalties because the company self-reported its misconduct.___Michael Goldberg is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Cisco Systems Inc., the largest maker of computer networking equipment, gave a lukewarm revenue forecast for the coming fiscal year, adding to concern that spending on tech infrastructure is slowing.Sales will be $57 billion to $58.2 billion in fiscal 2024, the company said Wednesday in a statement. That’s just shy of the $58.3 billion analysts had estimated on average, according to a Bloomberg survey.The outlook signals that Cisco’s growth will decelerate sharply from the 11% jump it experienced in the just-ended fiscal year. The company had seen orders stack up during a prolonged period of component shortages. With those parts now available, the company has been able to ship hardware — and sell associated software — to meet pent-up demand. But that surge is fading.Cisco shares fell about 2% in extended trading following the announcement. The stock closed at $52.96 on Wednesday, leaving it up 11% this year.In the period ending in October, sales will rise to about $14.6 billion, That’s in line with analysts’ estimates of $14.57 billion. Excluding certain items, profit will be roughly $1.03 a share, compared with an average estimate of 99 cents.Chief Executive Officer Chuck Robbins has been working for years to remake his company as a provider of networking services and software. His management team points to the amount of recurring revenue that it’s building up as an indication that the transition is succeeding.In Cisco’s fiscal fourth quarter, which ended July 29, revenue rose 16% to $15.2 billion. Profit, minus some items, was $1.14 a share. That compares with estimates of about $15.1 billion in revenue and $1.06 a share in earnings.Story continues©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: (Repeats story with no changes to text)*Fed policymakers divided in July over need for more rate hikes*Target gains on quarterly profit beat*Banks extend lossesBy Saeed Azhar and Noel RandewichNEW YORK, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Wall Street ended lower on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve's minutes showed central bank officials were divided over the need for more interest rate hikes at their last meeting.The minutes of the Fed's July meeting showed most policymakers continue to prioritize the battle against inflation, throwing in uncertainty for the markets over the outlook for rates."I agree with the governors that we're not convinced that inflation is totally in the rear view mirror," said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia."I think the markets will be on pins and needles regarding what the Fed will do all through September and into October.”According to preliminary data, the S&P 500 lost 33.62 points, or 0.76%, to end at 4,404.24 points, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 156.59 points, or 1.15%, to 13,474.45. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 179.86 points, or 0.51%, to 34,766.53.Bank shares extended losses, with the S&P 500 bank index down and Bank of America leading losses among bigger banks.Nvidia also reversed early gains to end lower after rising in the last two sessions, as two more brokerages raised their price targets on the stock ahead of the chip designer's quarterly results next week."Investors are starting to take a more sober look at the economic picture here," said Mike Reynolds, vice president of investment strategy at Glenmede.Equities have suffered through a rough patch in August, with the S&P 500 languishing near one-month lows as data underscoring sticky inflation and a robust economy fans fears of interest rates staying elevated for longer.While investors largely expect the Fed's monetary tightening to be nearing its end, worries linger the central bank could hold rates at the current level for longer.Target shares gained after the big-box retailer's second-quarter profit beat estimates.(Reporting by Saeed Azhar and Noel Randewich in New York, Amruta Khandekar and Shristi Achar A in Bengaluru; additional reporting by Lewis Krauskopf in New York Editing by Maju Samuel, Vinay Dwivedi and Deepa Babington)

Text Content: By Michael Martina and David ShepardsonWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Close to half of American adults support a ban on the Chinese-owned social media app TikTok, according to a new Reuters/Ipsos survey that also asked questions about national security concerns and China.TikTok, owned by Chinese tech giant ByteDance and used by tens of millions of Americans, has faced calls from U.S. lawmakers for a nationwide ban over concerns about possible Chinese government influence.Some 47% of respondents to the two-day poll, which concluded on Tuesday, said they at least somewhat supported "banning the social media application, TikTok, from use in the United States," while 36% opposed a ban and 17% said they didn't know.Fifty-eight percent of Republicans favored a ban, compared to 47% of Democrats, the poll showed.The survey also revealed deep worries among Americans about China's global influence at a time when U.S.-China relations have fallen to their lowest point in decades.The online Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted nationwide, collecting responses from 1,005 adults, including 443 Democrats and 346 Republicans. It had a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of about 4 percentage points in either direction.FBI Director Christopher Wray said in March that China's government could use TikTok to control software on millions of devices and drive narratives to divide Americans, adding that the app "screams" of national security concerns.Other top U.S. intelligence officials, including CIA Director William Burns, also have said TikTok poses a threat.TikTok said in a statement that more than 150 million Americans, including 5 million U.S. businesses, actively use TikTok to earn a living, engage in the classroom, and find community."We've taken unprecedented actions to safeguard protected U.S. user data, and we will continue working to build a safe, secure, and inclusive platform to ensure the positive experience of our users in every corner of the country," a TikTok spokesperson said.Story continuesEfforts to give the Biden administration new powers to ban TikTok have stalled in Congress. Last month U.S. lawmakers said they were considering changes to address concerns about the bill.Still, the issue could become a focus for Republicans in the 2024 U.S. presidential campaign, with some candidates backing a TikTok ban.Former President Donald Trump in 2020 sought to bar new downloads of TikTok but a series of court decisions blocked the ban from taking effect.Florida governor and presidential candidate Ron DeSantis has said he favors some form of national ban on the app.(Reporting by Michael Martina, David Shephardson and Jason Lange; Editing by Don Durfee, Sharon Singleton and David Gregorio)

Text Content: * Fed officials divided over need for more hikes- July minutes * IMF in touch with Argentina presidential candidates -source * Latam FX down 0.1%, stocks add 0.2% (Updated at 1911 GMT) By Ankika Biswas and Bansari Mayur Kamdar Aug 16 (Reuters) - Argentina's peso touched a fresh historic low in the black market and stocks hit an all-time high amid growing political and economic uncertainty, while the U.S. dollar extended gains after the Federal Reserve's July meeting minutes and kept most Latin American currencies under pressure. The Argentine peso weakened to as much as 785-per-dollar in the popular parallel market, more than double the official rate of 350 fixed by the central bank on Monday until the October general elections. The peso has been knocked down since far-right libertarian economist Javier Milei unexpectedly won a primary election over the weekend. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) reached out to the camps of Argentina presidential candidates Milei and Patricia Bullrich to coordinate meetings, a source close to the fund said on Tuesday. "It's a very blurry outlook for the Argentine peso... however, there are some investors being opportunistic with the quick drop in currency and value of bonds, but the central bank will need to unleash strong measures to stabilize the currency," said Maria Calderon, Head of LATAM sales at MarketAxess. Argentina's leading stock index S&P Merval, often used as a hedge against inflation, hit a record high and was last up 6.1%. Broadly, stocks in Latin America gained 0.2%. The MSCI Latin American currencies index slipped 0.1%, reversing an early advance, as the dollar gained after minutes showed Fed officials were divided over the need for more rate hikes in the July meeting, with "some participants" citing risks to the economy. "Latam markets are deeply affected by the Fed's decisions because that determines the spread between the U.S. rates and their local currencies, while also taking into account all the local risks," Calderon noted, while adding that any pause in the Fed's market-punishing interest rate hikes may dent the dollar and in turn boost Latam markets. A drop in crude oil prices also bruised top exporter Colombia's peso, while lower copper prices dented top producers Chile's peso and Peru's sol, all down between 0.6% and 1.5%. Bucking the trend was Brazil's real gaining 0.2%. The country's central bank governor Roberto Campos Neto said average core inflation has been falling but remains well above what policymakers would like, reaffirming the fight against inflation has not been won. With less than a month until the ruling party's presidential candidate is announced, former Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum grew her lead to a 13-point advantage, a poll showed. Mexico's peso was up 0.2% amid increased demand for the local currency.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Argentina’s presidential frontrunner Javier Milei would freeze relations with China and pull South America’s second-biggest economy out of the Mercosur trade bloc with Brazil, foreign policy proposals that are as radical as his economics.In an interview following his unexpected primary victory Aug. 13, the outsider candidate has given international policymakers the biggest insight yet in how he would conduct Argentina’s affairs on the world stage.“People are not free in China, they can’t do what they want and when they do it, they get killed,” he told Bloomberg News on Wednesday, referring to Beijing’s government. “Would you trade with an assassin?”Read More: Milei Vows to Pay Argentina’s Debt While Shuttering Central BankMilei shook Argentina’s political establishment last weekend after receiving more votes than a probusiness opposition bloc and the ruling Peronist coalition, putting him in the lead to be the country’s next president. His election in October would generate shock waves across a region largely ruled by leftist leaders.In his blanket refusal to do any kind of business with “socialists,” he lumped Communist China in the same category as Argentina’s biggest trade partner, Brazil, led by leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. China is the second-largest buyer of Argentine exports and provides a crucial $18 billion swap line with the central bank that’s being used to pay the International Monetary Fund.He described his foreign policy proposals as a global “fight against socialists and statists,” and revealed that he would appoint Diana Mondino, a trusted economic adviser, to be his top diplomat. She’s a former Standard & Poor’s director for Argentina and is running for Congress.Story continuesBrazil’s foreign affairs ministry didn’t immediately comment on Milei’s remarks and calls put to China’s embassy in Buenos Aires went unanswered.Not InvolvedHe later clarified that it’s up to the private sector to decide whether to maintain commercial relations with China and other countries whose leaders he has a strong distaste of.“I don’t have to get involved, but I won’t promote ties with those who don’t respect freedom,” he said, adding that he’d respect deals already signed in Argentina by Chinese companies, which include a contract to build twin dams in Patagonia and an agreement to set up a nuclear plant.The biggest geopolitical beneficiary of Milei’s ideology would clearly be the US. He was adamant he would work with any president elected in 2024, regardless of their political stripes, though he has a preference for a conservative.Right now Donald Trump is ahead in the polls to secure the Republican nomination but Milei isn’t especially keen on being oft-compared to the former US president. Asked if he would like Trump to return to the White House, he said cautiously: “That’s up for Americans to decide.”“I may like the profile of Republicans better than that of Democrats, but that doesn’t mean I don’t consider the US as our big strategic partner,” he said.Meanwhile, he’s put Lula, Mexico’s Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, Chile’s Gabriel Boric and Colombia’s Gustavo Petro, the leftists who run Latin America’s top economies, on guard. Asked about how his relations with them would be, he said: “I don’t have socialist partners.” In the meantime, his relationship with Lula’s predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro, is “excellent.”Milei was disparaging of the trade alliance that Argentina founded with Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay more than three decades ago. The group, beset by internal divisions, has struggled to implement a free-trade deal with the European Union agreed four years ago.“Mercosur is a customs union of poor quality that creates trade distortions and hurts its members,” he said.Unsurprisingly, Milei was equally critical of Venezuela’s Nicolas Maduro, who he called a “dictator,” as well as the governments of Nicaragua, Cuba, North Korea and Russia. Argentina would again condemn Venezuela for its violation of human rights if he is picked president, Milei said, returning to the hard-line policy the country had until 2019 with President Mauricio Macri.Read More: Argentina’s Milei Wouldn’t Dollarize Overnight, Adviser Says--With assistance from Simone Iglesias, Patrick Gillespie and Jonathan Gilbert.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: Walmart (WMT) has been working overtime ahead of its earnings report.America's biggest retailer will deliver second quarter results before the market open on Thursday, offering up another sign on the consumer and economy following a dreary outlook from competitor Target (TGT).Analysts expect a lift in same-store sales as consumers turn to the retail giant for value and to stock their fridges, bookshelves, and backpacks ahead of the back-to-school season.This comes as consumers' wallets remain pinched from ongoing headwinds like higher gas prices, a slowdown in the US job market, the looming return of student loan payments this fall, higher mortgage rates, higher interest rates, and higher costs for groceries.While Walmart's primary retail business will likely get most of the attention in the quarter, its side hustles may also boost its bottom line.A shopper pushes a cart through the parking lot of a Walmart on the morning of Black Friday in Wilmington, Delaware, on November 25, 2022. (Photo by SAMUEL CORUM/AFP via Getty Images)According to Guggenheim analyst Robert Drbul, the retailer has two other "sizable opportunities" in its ad business and health and wellness business.The first is Walmart Connect, the company's media business it rebranded in 2021 in a bid to drive omnichannel connections. It's a "fast-growing media business as the company aspires to become the top 10 advertiser in the US," Drbul told Yahoo Finance.Furthermore, the business could represent a multibillion-dollar opportunity for the company, Drbul said, given "Walmart’s vision, reach, and ambition."As of June, some of its partners include NBCUniversal, Roku, TikTok, and TalkShopLive. Its growth strategy allows the retail giant to understand consumers' behaviors and refine ad targets as the company focuses on e-commerce sales, which are expected to have increased by 1.5% last quarter.And as the ad market roars back, Walmart Connect and its peers are proving to be pretty immune to macroeconomic headwinds."Now is the time to be advertising to stay top of mind with consumers and make sure that your brand message comes across loud and clear," Ryan Mayward, a senior vice president of sales at Walmart Connect, told Yahoo Finance ahead of the company's annual meeting in May.Story continuesWalmart by the numbers (Credit: Yahoo Finance, Source: Walmart)The other driver is Walmart's health and wellness business. Since 2019, the retail giant has built up Walmart Health, aimed at making healthcare more accessible using the retailers existing US footprint of 4,684 locations.By the end of 2024, the company plans to double its health center footprint with more than 75 locations in the US in states including Texas, Arizona, Kansas, Missouri, and Florida. Walmart also moved into virtual health offerings by acquiring telehealth provider MeMD in 2021.Drbul said that expansion was "amplified by the recent end of partnership with National Vision," an optical retailer that operates vision centers at select Walmart locations.Meanwhile, Walmart announced it raised wages for more than 7,000 opticians and pharmacists. The company said in the release it is "serious about being an employer of choice for the talented individuals in these fields."The average salary for Walmart pharmacists is now more than $140,000, while the average wage for opticians is more than $22.50 an hour.Walmart stock was roughly flat in afternoon trading on Wednesday ahead of earnings.The earnings rundown:Here's what Wall Street expects, according to Bloomberg data.What analysts said pre-earnings: —Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 179.86 points, or 0.51%, to 34,766.53.Bank shares extended losses, with the S&P 500 bank index down and Bank of America leading losses among bigger banks.Nvidia also reversed early gains to end lower after rising in the last two sessions, as two more brokerages raised their price targets on the stock ahead of the chip designer's quarterly results next week."Investors are starting to take a more sober look at the economic picture here," said Mike Reynolds, vice president of investment strategy at Glenmede.Equities have suffered through a rough patch in August, with the S&P 500 languishing near one-month lows as data underscoring sticky inflation and a robust economy fans fears of interest rates staying elevated for longer.Story continuesWhile investors largely expect the Fed's monetary tightening to be nearing its end, worries linger the central bank could hold rates at the current level for longer.Target shares gained after the big-box retailer's second-quarter profit beat estimates.(Reporting by Saeed Azhar and Noel Randewich in New York, Amruta Khandekar and Shristi Achar A in Bengaluru; additional reporting by Lewis Krauskopf in New York Editing by Maju Samuel, Vinay Dwivedi and Deepa Babington)

Text Content: ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) — Atlantic City's casinos, the three New Jersey horse tracks that take sports bets, and their online partners won over half a billion dollars from gamblers in July, up 5.3% from a year earlier, figures released Wednesday show.The month was particularly good for Atlantic City's top-performing casino, the Borgata, which broke its own record for the most money any Atlantic City casino has ever won in a single month, with more than $127 million in casino, internet and sports betting winnings.But the amount of money won from in-person gamblers at the nine casinos declined by 3% compared with a year ago, to less than $290 million.Jane Bokunewicz, director of the Lloyd Levenson Institute at Stockton University, which studies the Atlantic City gambling industry, said the 3% dip is not particularly worrisome.“As is the nature of the gaming industry, there are always fluctuations in the monthly revenues and this 3% decline does not appear to be part of a lasting trend,” she said.Total gambling revenue, including money from internet and sports betting at casinos and three horse racing tracks, was $506 million in July.That number was the highest in any July in over a decade, said James Plousis, chairman of the New Jersey Casino Control Commission.The amount of money won from gamblers physically present on casino floors is the key metric for Atlantic City casino executives. Internet and sports betting money helps the bottom line somewhat, but that money must be shared with third parties such as sports books and technology platforms, and is not solely for the casinos to keep.In-person gambling is also a closely watched metric when compared to the levels the casinos were experiencing before the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Just two of the nine casinos — Hard Rock and Ocean — won more from in-person gamblers last month than they did in July 2019, although several came close to equaling that mark.The Borgata's record-breaking $127 million total win in July was up nearly 3% from a year earlier. It broke its own monthly revenue record of $124 million in July 2022.Story continuesBorgata president Travis Lunn said the strong performance is due to positive customer response to the former Water Club hotel, now redone as the MGM Tower; a high-limit slots lounge and a new restaurant, none of which were available a year ago.Hard Rock won $62.7 million in July, up nearly 5%; Golden Nugget won nearly $54 million, up nearly 10%; Ocean won $42.4 million, down 2%; Tropicana won $32.3 million, down nearly 10%; Harrah's won $25.2 million, down 4.2%; Caesars won $25.1 million, down 1.5%; Bally's won $24.1 million, up more than 16%, and Resorts won $15.3 million, down more than 16%. Resorts Digital, the casino's online arm, won $59.5 million, up nearly 53%.The online-only Caesars Entertainment Interactive NJ won $8.5 million, down nearly 22%.The casinos and three horse tracks took $587 million in sports bets in July, keeping $61 million of that as revenue after paying off winning bets and other expenses.Internet betting brought in $155 million in July, up 13.5% from a year earlier.___Follow Wayne Parry on X, formerly known as Twitter, at www.twitter.com/WayneParryAC.

Text Content: Jerry Moss, a music industry giant who co-founded A&M Records with Herb Alpert and rose from a Los Angeles garage to the heights of success with hits by Alpert, the Police, the Carpenters and hundreds of other performers, has died at age 88.Moss, inducted with Alpert into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006, died Wednesday at his home in Bel Air, California, according to a statement released by his family.“They truly don’t make them like him anymore and we will miss conversations with him about everything under the sun,” the statement reads in part, “the twinkle in his eyes as he approached every moment ready for the next adventure.”For more than 25 years, Alpert and Moss presided over one of the industry's most successful independent labels, releasing such blockbuster albums as Albert's “Whipped Cream & Other Delights,” Carole King's “Tapestry” and Peter Frampton's “Frampton Comes Alive!” They were home to the Carpenters and Cat Stevens,Janet Jackson and Soundgarden,Joe Cocker and Suzanne Vega, the Go-Gos and Sheryl Crow.Among the label's singles: Alpert's “A Taste of Honey,” the Captain and Tennille's “Love Will Keep Us Together,” Frampton's “Show Me the Way” and “Every Breath You Take,” by the Police.“Every once in a while a record would come through us and Herbie would look at me and say, ‘What did we do to deserve this, that this amazing thing is going to come out on our label?’” Moss told Artist House Music, an archive and resource center, in 2007.His music connections also led to a lucrative horse racing business that he owned with his first wife, Ann Holbrook. In 1962, record manufacturer Nate Duroff lent Alpert and Moss $35,000 so they could print 350,000 copies of Alpert's instrumental "The Lonely Bull," the label's first major hit. A decade later, Duroff convinced Moss to invest in horses.The Mosses' Giacomo, named for the son of A&M artist Sting, won the Kentucky Derby in 2005. Zenyatta, in honor of the Police album "Zenyatta Mondatta," was runner-up for Horse of the Year in 2008 and 2009 and won the following year. A hit single by Sting gave Moss the name for another profitable horse, Set Them Free.Story continuesMoss' survivors include his second wife, Tina Morse, and three children.Born in New York City and an English major at Brooklyn College, Moss had wanted to work in show business since waiting tables in his 20s and noticing that the entertainment industry patrons seemed to be having so much fun. After a six-month Army stint, he found work as a promoter for Coed Records and eventually moved to Los Angeles, where he met and befriended Alpert, a trumpeter, songwriter and entrepreneur.With an investment of $100 each, they formed Carnival Records and had a local hit with "Tell It to the Birds," an Alpert ballad released under the name of his son, Dore Alpert. After learning that another company was called Carnival, Alpert and Moss used the initials of their last names and renamed their business A&M, working out an office in Alpert's garage and designing the distinctive logo with the trumpet across the bottom."We had a desk, piano, piano stool, a couch, coffee table and two phone lines. And that for the two of us worked out very well, because we could go over the songs on the piano and make phone calls to the distributors," Moss later told Billboard. "We also had an answering service at the time. I'd do all my own billing."For several years they specialized in "easy listening" acts such as Alpert and the Tijuana Brass, Brazilian artist Sergio Mendes and the folk-rock trio the Sandpipers. After attending the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967, rock's first major festival, Moss began adding rock performers, including Cocker, Procol Harum and Free.One of their biggest triumphs was "Frampton Comes Alive!" a live double album from 1976 that sold more than 6 million copies in its first year and transformed Frampton from mid-level performer to superstar."Peter was a huge live star in markets like Detroit and San Francisco, so we made a suggestion that he make a live record," Moss told Rolling Stone in 2002. "What he was doing onstage wasn't like the records — it was outrageously better. I remember being at the mix of 'Frampton Comes Alive!' at Electric Lady studios, and I was so blown away I asked to make it a double album."A&M continued to expand their catalog through the 1970s and '80s, taking on the Police, Squeeze, Joe Jackson and other British New Wave artists, R&B musicians Janet Jackson and Barry White and country rockers 38 Special and the Ozark Mountain Daredevils.By the late '80s, Alpert and Moss were operating out of a Hollywood lot where Charlie Chaplin once made movies, but they struggled to keep up with ever-higher recording contracts and sold A&M to Polygram for an estimated $500 million. They remained at the label, but clashed with Polygram's management and left in 1993, one of their last signings a singer-musician from Kennett, Missouri: Sheryl Crow. (Alpert and Moss later sued Polygram for violating their contract’s integrity clause and reached a $200 million settlement.)For a few years, Alpert and Moss ran Almo Records, where performers included Garbage, Imogen Heap and Gillian Welch."We wanted people to be happy," Moss told The New York Times in 2010. “You can't force people to do a certain kind of music. They make their best music when they are doing what they want to do, not what we want them to do.”

Text Content: Eight months after 2023 kicked off with widespread recession calls across Wall Street, the Atlanta Fed is projecting the economy will grow nearly 6% in the third quarter.On Tuesday, the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow estimate moved up to 5.8% from 5.0% a day prior after fresh data from the Census Bureau's showed housing starts increased 3.9%. in June. If the 5.8% GDP growth number held, it'd mark the most robust period of economic growth since the fourth quarter of 2021.The higher projection from the Atlanta Fed is the latest piece of data pointing to a stronger than expected US economy. On Tuesday, July's retail sales report revealed sales increased 0.7% in the month with the control group, which contributes directly to Gross Domestic Product (GDP), rising 1.0%. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected just a 0.5% increase for the control group.The upbeat print on the consumer came after recent jobs data showed the economy is still adding jobs while unemployment remains historically low and monthly wage growth has begun to outpace inflation, providing a potential boost for further consumer spending.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.2023 has been marked by upward revisions to economic growth. An initial reading for first quarter GDP of 1.1% was boosted to 2.0%. The first reading of second quarter GDP came in hotter than expected, too. A 2.4% reading in late July, revealed the economy grew at a faster pace in the second quarter. The growth has become so robust to the upside that some economists are now beginning to question if the positive data could be detrimental to recent improvements on the inflation front."While good news for the near-term real GDP growth outlook (Q3 is likely to print at least 2% annualize and probably stronger), the resilience of the US consumer complicates the picture for the Fed," Citi US economics research analyst Gisela Hoxha wrote in a note on Tuesday after the release of the retail sales report. "Upside surprises to demand for goods mean increasing upside risk to prices for a category of inflation that has been reliably soft this year."Story continuesThis content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Still, Thursday's upgrade to the GDPNow forecast comes just midway through the third quarter with a substantial amount of data before the quarter closes at the end of September.Fed Chair Jerome Powell is expected to address the state of the economy and the fight against inflation during the 2023 Economic Policy Symposium in Jackson Hole which begins on August 24.Per minutes from the Fed's July meeting released on Wednesday, central bank officials still view inflation as "unacceptably high." Most officials said they see still significant upside risks to inflation. "Participants continued to view a period of below-trend growth in real GDP and some softening in labor market conditions as needed to bring aggregate supply and aggregate demand into better balance and reduce inflation pressures sufficiently to return inflation to 2 percent over time," the minutes read.A large U.S. flag hangs on the facade of the New York Stock Exchange in New York September 3, 2015.

Text Content: By Jonathan Stempel and Nate RaymondNEW YORK, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Sixteen people who witnessed a white supremacist kill 10 Blacks in a shooting last year at a Buffalo, New York grocery store have sued social media and firearms-related companies, to hold them liable for causing emotional trauma.The complaint filed on Tuesday in a state court in Buffalo names as defendants YouTube and Reddit, where the gunman Payton Gendron was allegedly radicalized through exposure to harmful content, and learned information to help carry out his attack.Also sued were three retailers--Mean Arms, Vintage Firearms and RMA Armament--that allegedly sold firearm equipment and body armor that Gendron used.Alphabet and Google, which own YouTube, are also defendants, as are Gendron's parents. The civil lawsuit was filed by the nonprofit Everytown for Gun Safety.A YouTube spokesman on Wednesday said the company had "deepest sympathies" for attack victims and families, has invested over the years to find and remove extremist content.RMA's lawyer said he looked forward to vindicating his client in court, while calling the attack "reprehensible" and saying RMA "condemns everything the shooter stood for."A lawyer for Mean Arms declined to comment. The other defendants did not immediately respond to requests for comment.While the same defendants face other civil litigation over the May 14, 2022 attack at the Tops grocery store, Tuesday's lawsuit differs because the plaintiffs had not suffered serious physical injuries, or were related to people who did.The plaintiffs include store employees and customers who said the shooting left them with long-lasting emotional distress, and symptoms including anxiety, depression, insomnia, lethargy and nightmares.One plaintiff, Fragrance Harris Stanfield, said she was unable to return to work at Tops or as a substitute teacher in Buffalo schools, and has had panic attacks at stores when she could not locate an exit.Story continuesThe plaintiff DennisJanee Brown said she feels uneasy at work in the presence of white people, while the plaintiff Rose Marie Wysocki said she has felt "enormous guilt and anger," feeling as though she survived because she was white.Through the defendants' alleged negligence, Gendron "gained the racist motivation, tools and knowledge necessary for him to commit the mass shooting," the complaint said.Gendron, 18 at the time of the attack, was sentenced in February to life in prison without parole, after pleading guilty to charges including murder and terrorism motivated by hate. New York does not have a death penalty.(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York and Nate Raymond in Boston; Editing by Aurora Ellis)

Text Content: (Updated at 1530 EDT (1930 GMT) By Karen Brettell NEW YORK, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields hit a 10-month high on Wednesday after minutes from the Federal Reserve’s July meeting showed that Fed officials were divided over the need for more interest rate hikes, though “most” policymakers continued to prioritize the battle against inflation. “Some participants" cited the risks to the economy of pushing rates too far, however, and cautionary voices about the effects of continued monetary tightening appeared to play a more prominent role in the debate at last month's policy meeting. The U.S. central bank hiked rates by 25 basis points at the meeting and Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the economy still needed to slow and the labor market to weaken for inflation to "credibly" return to the U.S. central bank's 2% target. “They’re not quite sure how much of their policy has already affected the economy, and to what extent it still is going to,” said Lou Brien, market strategist at DRW Trading in Chicago. “They commented before that’s one of the reasons that they paused a couple of meetings ago... to try to assess the effect of the cumulative moves and the effect of how much more is to come - and it doesn’t seem to me that they have really answered that question yet.” Benchmark 10-year yields reached 4.280%, the highest since Oct. 24. A break above the 4.338% level reached in October would bring yields to their highest since 2007. Interest rate-sensitive two-year yields were at 4.984%. They are holding below yields of 5.120% reached on July 6, which were the highest since June 2007. The inversion in the yield curve between two-year and 10-year notes narrowed to minus 71 basis points. The next Fed focus will be the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyo., between Aug. 24 and Aug. 26. The Fed’s Sept. 19-20 meeting will also give new interest rate clues as Fed officials will update their interest rate projections for the coming quarters. Yields also rose earlier on Wednesday after two U.S. economic reports beat economists’ expectations. U.S. single-family homebuilding surged in July amid an acute shortage of previously owned houses. U.S. July industrial output, meanwhile, rose by 1.0%, beating expectations for a 0.3% gain. Data on Tuesday also showed that retail sales rose more than expected in July. Still, Ben Jeffery, an interest rate strategist at BMO Capital Markets, noted that Tuesday's selloff reached levels that were attractive to buyers and several factors might support lower yields. “We have gotten still good but no longer accelerating NFP (nonfarm payroll) prints, (and) a couple of CPI prints that show disinflation is continuing," Jeffery said. "I would say the consensus at this point is that the Fed will not hike in September even if they may hike in November/December, and I think all of these things are probably translating into increased comfort in buying dips.” Concerns about China’s economy are also adding to fears of a global slowdown. Missed payments on investment products by a leading Chinese trust firm and a fall in home prices have added to worries that China's deepening property sector crisis is stifling what little momentum the economy has left. In the longer-term, however, analysts also note that increasing Treasury supply due to a deteriorating U.S. deficit and the potential for lower demand from Japanese investors as the Bank of Japan shifts away from its ultra loose monetary policy could keep U.S. Treasury yields higher than they would otherwise be.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Argentina’s leading presidential candidate Javier Milei pledged to close the nation’s central bank while saying he would make every effort to avoid a default on the country’s sovereign debt if he wins the October vote.Milei, a radical libertarian whose surprise win in Sunday’s primary vote roiled markets, told Bloomberg News his bold fiscal adjustment will boost Argentina’s reputation and credit profile, making a default unnecessary.His plan includes slashing spending by at least 13% of gross domestic product before mid-2025 by dramatically downsizing public works, reducing the number of ministries, removing subsidies and capital restrictions that would allow businesses to transact in US dollars. More drastically, he also plans to shutter the central bank — which he said has “no reason to exist” — and dollarize the $640 billion economy.“I will make every effort to avoid a default, obviously,” Milei said in a two-hour-long interview in Buenos Aires Wednesday. “If you do the fiscal adjustment that’s needed, the financing will be there.”Argentina’s assets sold off after Milei, an outsider few investors saw as a serious contender until now, came out ahead in the primary, seen as a barometer for presidential elections in a country where polls are notoriously unreliable. The slump forced the government to devalue its tightly controlled official exchange rate by 18% when markets opened Monday.Read More: Argentine Shops Hit With 20% Overnight Price Hike After ElectionIn the first interview to foreign media after his unexpected win, Milei detailed his plan to scrap the Argentine peso for the US dollar as a way to bring down inflation that’s running at 113%, and upped his criticism of the central bank, which he called “the worst garbage that exists on this Earth.”Story continues“Central banks are divided in four categories: the bad ones, like the Federal Reserve, the very bad ones, like the ones in Latin America, the horribly bad ones, and the Central Bank of Argentina,” he said.If Milei wins the presidency, he plans to hand over the keys to the central bank to economist Emilio Ocampo, his informal adviser on the dollarization program, so that he can shut it down. Ocampo will also help in negotiations with the International Monetary Fund, which has a $44 billion program with the South American nation. The candidate says he has no plans to ask the IMF for more money.“A fiscal deficit is immoral,” Milei said. “If you live continually with a fiscal deficit, you’re going to be insolvent.”Milei said he’s already developed a plan to dollarize the economy, a move he vows would be among his first in case he wins the Oct. 22 election. Argentina would follow El Salvador’s model, allowing people voluntarily choose between currencies. Once two-thirds of the monetary base is converted, the economy would become fully dollarized, he said.“If nobody wants to have pesos in Argentina, the question is how much are pesos worth in real terms? Nobody wants them, we’re not talking about water in the middle of the desert. We’re talking about something nobody wants,” Milei said.The one-time congressman obtained more votes than the pro business coalition led by Patricia Bullrich and the ruling Peronist bloc of Economy Minister Sergio Massa, surprising pollsters who expected him to come in third. Investors are worried the country is headed for its fourth debt workout in the past two decades.Read More: Week of Shocks Leaves Investors Dreading Next Argentina DefaultAmong chief concerns for markets is that Milei, a political outsider, wouldn’t be able to get backing for his plans. The 52 year-old, who doesn’t shy away from criticizing politicians he says have been robbing Argentines for decades, said he would call referendums if he can’t get legislative consensus to approve his measures.“If I lower the currency risk, and I lower the credit risk, that means country risk will plummet. It means that bonds are literally going to fly,” he said. “The truth is its a pretty simple trade. Or, if you buy and hold, for example, returns in a year would be above 200%.”In the wide-ranging interview, Milei also criticized China and Latin America leftist leaders he considers “socialists,” said he would seek to leave the Mercosur trade bloc and would quickly move to deregulate commodity markets.--With assistance from Patrick Gillespie and Sydney Maki.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: (Adds latest prices in paragraphs 2-3) Aug 16 (Reuters) - U.S. natural gas futures fell over 2% to more than a one-week low on Wednesday on forecasts for cooler weather, especially in the northeastern part of the U.S. Front-month gas futures for September delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange settled 6.7 cents, or 2.5% lower, at $2.592 per million British thermal units (mmBtu). The contract fell nearly 5% on Tuesday. Although the weather in the lower 48 states is forecast to remain hotter than normal through at least Aug. 31, it will be significantly milder during that period and heading into September than recently, especially in the heavily populated Northeast region. That is pulling back expectations for any late-season power sector demand for cooling, said Gary Cunningham, director of market research at Tradition Energy. Data provider Refinitiv forecast U.S. gas demand, including exports, would rise from 104.9 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) this week to 106.6 bcfd next week. These numbers were higher from Tuesday's forecast. Refinitiv said average gas output in the Lower 48 states was 101.8 bcfd so far in August, matching the reading in July, and not far from a monthly record of 102.2 bcfd in May. Gas flows to the seven big U.S. LNG export plants have fallen from an average of 12.7 bcfd in July to 12.4 bcfd so far in August, mainly due to reductions at Venture Global LNG's Calcasieu facility in Louisiana. That compares with a monthly record of 14.0 bcfd in April. Market participants were keeping a close watch on any updates on possible strikes at Australian liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities that would lead to supply disruptions. Gas prices in Europe were down 3.45 euros at 37.40 euros per megawatt hour (MWh) by 1421 GMT. Woodside Energy said "positive progress" was being made on wage disputes at Australia's largest LNG facility even as a union alliance said key differences remained ahead of further talks next Wednesday. The U.S. is on track to become the world's biggest LNG supplier in 2023 - ahead of recent leaders Australia and Qatar - as higher global prices feed demand for U.S. exports due to supply disruptions and sanctions linked to the war in Ukraine.

"So we intend, again, to keep policy restrictive until we're confident that inflation is coming down sustainably to our 2% target, and we’re prepared to further tighten if that is appropriate."Markets are currently pricing in an 88.5% chance that the Fed maintains its benchmark interest rate in a range of 5.25% to 5.50% at the next meeting in September, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.At the July meeting several officials commented that significant disinflationary pressures had yet to become apparent in the prices of core services excluding housing.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Fed officials said they would need to see more data on inflation and further signs that supply and demand were moving into better balance to be confident that inflation was on course to return to 2% over time.And while officials acknowledged a slowdown in job growth recently, they felt the level of payrolls was above what was needed to sustain unemployment at current levels and that nominal wages were still rising at rates above levels consistent with 2% inflation."Participants judged that further progress toward a balancing of demand and supply in the labor market was needed, and they expected that additional softening in labor market conditions would take place over time."Data in the coming months will be key, according to comments made at the July meeting, helping to "clarify the extent to which the disinflation process was continuing."Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance

Text Content: (Updated at 1500 EDT (1900 GMT)) By Karen Brettell NEW YORK, Aug 16 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury yields hit session highs on Wednesday after minutes from the Federal Reserve’s July meeting showed that Fed officials were divided over the need for more interest rate hikes, though “most” policymakers continued to prioritize the battle against inflation. “Some participants" cited the risks to the economy of pushing rates too far, however, and cautionary voices about the effects of continued monetary tightening appeared to play a more prominent role in the debate at last month's policy meeting. The U.S. central bank hiked rates by 25 basis points at the meeting and Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the economy still needed to slow and the labor market to weaken for inflation to "credibly" return to the U.S. central bank's 2% target. “They’re not quite sure how much of their policy has already affected the economy, and to what extent it still is going to,” said Lou Brien, market strategist at DRW Trading in Chicago. “They commented before that’s one of the reasons that they paused a couple of meetings ago... to try to assess the effect of the cumulative moves and the effect of how much more is to come - and it doesn’t seem to me that they have really answered that question yet.” Benchmark 10-year yields were last at 4.260%, after reaching a 10-month high of 4.274% on Tuesday. A break above the 4.338% level reached in October would bring yields to their highest since 2007. Interest rate sensitive two-year yields were at 4.980%. They are holding below yields of 5.120% reached on July 6, which were the highest since June 2007. The inversion in the yield curve between two-year and 10-year notes narrowed to minus 72 basis points. The next Fed focus will be the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyo., between Aug. 24 and Aug. 26. The Fed’s Sept. 19-20 meeting will also give new interest rate clues as Fed officials will update their interest rate projections for the coming quarters. Yields also rose earlier on Wednesday after two U.S. economic reports beat economists’ expectations. U.S. single-family homebuilding surged in July amid an acute shortage of previously owned houses. U.S. July industrial output, meanwhile, rose by 1.0%, beating expectations for a 0.3% gain. Data on Tuesday also showed that retail sales rose more than expected in July. Still, Ben Jeffery, an interest rate strategist at BMO Capital Markets, noted that Tuesday's selloff reached levels that were attractive to buyers and several factors might support lower yields. “We have gotten still good but no longer accelerating NFP (nonfarm payroll) prints, (and) a couple of CPI prints that show disinflation is continuing," Jeffery said. "I would say the consensus at this point is that the Fed will not hike in September even if they may hike in November/December, and I think all of these things are probably translating into increased comfort in buying dips.” Concerns about China’s economy are also adding to fears of a global slowdown. Missed payments on investment products by a leading Chinese trust firm and a fall in home prices have added to worries that China's deepening property sector crisis is stifling what little momentum the economy has left. In the longer-term, however, analysts also note that increasing Treasury supply due to a deteriorating U.S. deficit and the potential for lower demand from Japanese investors as the Bank of Japan shifts away from its ultra loose monetary policy could keep U.S. Treasury yields higher than they would otherwise be.

Text Content: (Updates prices, adds analyst comment in paragraphs 4 and 5) By Hannah Lang WASHINGTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The Japanese yen further weakened against the dollar on Wednesday, hovering in a zone that last year triggered intervention, while the yuan slipped to a nine-month low as fears mounted about the extent of China's slowdown. The yen has hit the key 145 per dollar level for four sessions, which triggered heavy dollar selling by Japanese authorities in September and October last year. It last weakened 0.45% versus the greenback to 146.22 per dollar, after hitting 146.260, a level not seen since November. Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki said on Tuesday authorities were not targeting absolute currency levels for intervention. "Exactly when they'll intervene and at what level, I couldn't tell you, but I would expect it to be relatively soon, because inflation there still looks pretty bad," said Stephen Miran, co-founder at Amberwave Partners. "Letting the currency continue to do this when the rest of the world has much higher yields has the potential of exacerbating inflation there even further." Elsewhere in Asia, the yuan touched its lowest level since November in both the onshore and offshore markets as fears mounted about the extent of China's slowdown, falling as low as 7.3397. That extended Tuesday's decline following Chinese data that missed forecasts and prompted Beijing to deliver unexpected cuts to its key policy rates as authorities there sought to shore up an economy that has rapidly lost steam in recent months. The Australian dollar, often used as a liquid proxy for the yuan, plumbed nine-month lows in response to the Chinese data. It last fell 0.46% versus the greenback at $0.643. "I really don't think that the backdrop is conducive for a sustained risk rally at this point," said Bipan Rai, global head of FX strategy at CIBC Capital Markets. "Not only the China data, it's also the fact that we're dealing with tighter monetary conditions globally, and that's going to crimp demand at the margin." CENTRAL BANK WATCH The pound was up after data showed British core inflation stayed strong in July, hitting a high of $1.2768 and was last up around 0.18% at $1.2725. In Britain, core inflation, which strips out volatile energy and food prices, remained at 6.9% in July, flat versus the June reading, and higher than expectations in a Reuters poll for a reading of 6.8%. The dollar index rose 0.213% at 103.420 after the release of the Federal Reserve's minutes showed central bank officials were divided over the need for more interest rate hikes at their last meeting. The euro was down 0.22% to $1.08795. The New Zealand dollar, which had fallen to a nine-month low of $0.5932 in early Asian trade, rebounded after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand policy meeting, but last fell 0.27% versus the greenback at $0.594. The central bank held its cash rate steady as expected on Wednesday, but slightly pushed out when it expects to start cutting borrowing costs to 2025. "The statement gave a clearly more hawkish tone, likely defying any dovish expectations," said Barclays research analyst Shreya Sodhani. "We think today's more hawkish statement and the governor's press conference suggest that the timing of rate cuts will likely be pushed back a bit." ======================================================== Currency bid prices at 3:00PM (1900 GMT) Description RIC Last U.S. Close Pct Change YTD Pct High Bid Low Bid Previous Change Session Dollar index 103.4200 103.2100 +0.21% -0.068% +103.4500 +102.9400 Euro/Dollar $1.0879 $1.0904 -0.22% +1.54% +$1.0934 +$1.0878 Dollar/Yen 146.2300 145.5700 +0.46% +11.54% +146.2550 +145.3100 Euro/Yen 159.10 158.74 +0.23% +13.40% +159.2500 +158.6400 Dollar/Swiss 0.8798 0.8786 +0.13% -4.86% +0.8814 +0.8775 Sterling/Dollar $1.2724 $1.2702 +0.18% +5.22% +$1.2766 +$1.2689 Dollar/Canadian 1.3534 1.3497 +0.27% -0.11% +1.3539 +1.3476 Aussie/Dollar $0.6426 $0.6456 -0.46% -5.73% +$0.6481 +$0.6423 Euro/Swiss 0.9570 0.9579 -0.09% -3.28% +0.9611 +0.9567 Euro/Sterling 0.8548 0.8583 -0.41% -3.35% +0.8593 +0.8547 NZ $0.5934 $0.5951 -0.27% -6.53% +$0.5993 +$0.5932 Dollar/Dollar Dollar/Norway 10.6090 10.5370 +0.70% +8.12% +10.6120 +10.5010 Euro/Norway 11.5395 11.4852 +0.47% +9.97% +11.5567 +11.4425 Dollar/Sweden 10.9182 10.8523 +0.33% +4.90% +10.9300 +10.8259 Euro/Sweden 11.8743 11.8354 +0.33% +6.50% +11.8913 +11.8260 (Reporting by Hannah Lang in Washington; additional reporting by Samuel Indyk in London and Rae Wee; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Bernadette Baum)

Text Content: ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — There is going to be a new way to get around downtown Orlando, Florida, and it's not going to require any human drivers.Starting later this month, an electric, self-driving shuttle will whisk passengers around a 1-mile (1.6 km) loop in the downtown area for no charge, Orlando officials said Wednesday.The eight-passenger shuttle service is part of a six-month trial for the central Florida city. Transportation planners hope to use data gathered from the pilot program to guide the city's future transportation strategy.“With the expansion of autonomous vehicle shuttles into our neighborhoods, we can converge cutting-edge technology with new mobility solutions to further redefine the way our community moves," Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer said.The autonomous shuttle service is operated by Beep Inc., an Orlando-based company that already operates a similar service in a planned community near Orlando International Airport.

Text Content: (Adds minutes paragraph 13, data paragraph 17)By Howard Schneider, Indradip GhoshWASHINGTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Blame it on economic theory not matching reality, groupthink among forecasters, or political partisanship by opponents of the Biden administration, but a year ago much of the U.S. was convinced the country was in a recession, or would be soon.The first two quarters of 2022 had seen U.S. economic output contract at a 1.6% annual rate from January through March and at a 0.6% annual rate from April through June. By one common, though not technically accurate, definition the country had already entered a downturn.Why wouldn't it? The Federal Reserve was quickly cranking interest rates higher, housing investment seemed to be buckling, and the conventional wisdom was that other industries, consumer spending, and the job market would all tumble as well."A number of forces have coincided to slow economic momentum more rapidly than we previously expected," Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Bank of America, said in a July 2022 analysis. "We now forecast a mild recession in the U.S. economy this year ... In addition to fading of prior fiscal support ... inflation shocks have eaten into real spending power of households more forcefully than we forecasted previously and financial conditions have tightened noticeably as the Fed shifted its tone toward more rapid increases in its policy rate."Fast forward a year, and the unemployment rate at 3.5% in July is actually lower than the point where many analysts expected it to begin rising, consumers continue to spend, and many professional economic forecasts have followed Gapen in a course correction. Reuters polls of economists over the past year showed the risk of a recession one year out rising from 25% in April 2022, the month after the first rate hike of the Fed's current tightening cycle, to 65% in October. The most recent read: 55%. "Incoming data has made us reassess our prior view" of a coming recession that had already been pushed into 2024, Gapen wrote earlier this month. "We revise our outlook in favor of a 'soft landing' where growth falls below trend in 2024, but remains positive throughout."Story continuesThe recession revisionists include the Fed's own staff, who followed their models to steadily downgrade the outlook for the U.S., moving from increased concerns about "downside risk" as of last autumn, to citing recession as a "plausible" outcome as of last December, and then projecting as of the Fed's March 2023 meeting that recession would begin this year.With the failure of California-based Silicon Valley Bank expected to put an extra constraint on bank credit, "the staff's projection ... included a mild recession starting later this year, with a recovery over the subsequent two years," the minutes of the Fed's March 21-22 meeting showed.In May and June, the Fed staff projections "continued to assume" the U.S. economy would be in recession by the end of the year. The more dour outlook disappeared at the July 25-26 meeting, according to newly released minutes."The staff no longer judged that the economy would enter a mild recession toward the end of the year," the minutes said, though the staff still felt the economy would slow to a growth rate below its long-run potential in 2024 and 2025, with inflation falling and risks "tilted to the downside."Fed policymakers' projections, which are issued on a quarterly basis and are independent of the staff view, never showed GDP contracting on an annual basis.'CHUGGING ALONG'What made the difference between an in-the-moment recession that many thought was underway last year to growth that has surprised to the upside?The forecast miss wasn't even really close: By the third quarter of last year, growth had rebounded to a rapid 3.2% annual rate, and has remained at 2% or above since then, higher than the 1.8% the Fed considers as the economy's underlying potential. An Atlanta Fed GDP "nowcast" puts output growth for the current July-September period at a startling 5.8%, showing continued strong momentum from consumption and a surprising bounce in industrial production and home starts. A big part of the story is the staying power of U.S. consumers, who have continued "chugging along" and spending more than expected, as Omair Sharif, president of Inflation Insights, puts it. Spending has shifted from the goods-gorging purchases seen at the start of the coronavirus pandemic to the hot services economy that exploded this summer in billion-dollar movie runs and music concerts.But the dollar amounts keep growing regardless of what's in the basket, leaving economists to steadily push back the date when the "excess savings" of the pandemic era will run dry, or puzzle over whether low unemployment, ongoing strong hiring and labor "hoarding" by companies, along with rising earnings, have trumped any anxiety over the outlook.But it isn't just that. It may be that high interest rates don't work the same way in an economy that spends more on less rate-sensitive services, and where businesses have continued to borrow and invest more than many economists anticipated - perhaps to capitalize on regulatory shifts aimed at encouraging technology and green energy projects.A surge in local government spending also gave an unexpected boost to growth as localities put pandemic-era funds to work on a delayed basis.Can it last?One risk is if inflation resurges alongside a tighter-than-expected economy, and Fed policy needs to become even stricter and induce the inflation-killing downturn that officials still hope to avoid.But the odds of that may be falling."We've been wavering for a while on whether to shift to the 'soft-landing' camp, but no longer," noted Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, in reference to the Fed's hopes of lowering inflation without provoking a recession."Broad strength" in the U.S. economy, he said, "convinced us that the U.S. economy is more durable than expected ... Not only is it not slowing further, it might be picking up."(Reporting by Howard Schneider; Editing by Paul Simao and Rosalba O'Brien)

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Citadel’s flagship Wellington fund is up about 9% for the year, after the firm run by billionaire Ken Griffin posted a record $16 billion profit in 2022.The multi-strategy Wellington fund gained 1.3% in July, with all of its core investment strategies, including commodities, up for the year, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be named discussing internal business.The strong performance comes as the rest of the hedge fund industry posts mixed results amid whipsawing oil prices and recessionary fears that have weighed on markets. Famed oil bull Pierre Andurand’s main fund, for example, saw one of its worst monthly performances during the first quarter before notching one of the best months on record in July this year.Citadel’s commodities business, led by Sebastian Barrack, has become an industry powerhouse in recent years. The company trades crude oil, refined products and natural gas and has recently added traders to boost its energy trading capabilities. A chunk of Citadel’s 38% gain last year came from commodity wagers, Business Insider reported earlier this year.--With assistance from Hema Parmar.©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: *Canadian dollar weakens 0.2% against the greenback*Touches its weakest since June 1 at 1.3539*Price of U.S. oil settles nearly 2% lower*Canadian bond yields edge higher across the curveBy Fergal SmithTORONTO, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar weakened to its lowest level in more than two months against its U.S. counterpart on Wednesday as the recent jump in long-term borrowing costs weighed on investor sentiment.The loonie was trading 0.2% lower at 1.3525 to the greenback, or 73.94 U.S. cents, after touching its weakest intraday level since June 1 at 1.3539.Risk-sensitive currencies, such as the Canadian dollar, "remain on the defensive," Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Corpay, said in a note.An aversion to risk is becoming more pronounced "as investors grapple with the prospect of higher long-term rates," Schamotta said.A combination of sticky inflation and robust economic growth, particularly in the United States, has fanned fears of interest rates staying higher for longer.Canada is a major produce or commodities, including oil, so the loonie tends to be sensitive to shifts in investor sentiment.U.S. crude oil futures settled nearly 2% lower at $79.38 a barrel as investors weighed worries about China's embattled economy against expectations of tighter supply in the United States.Canadian housing starts slipped by 10% in July compared with the previous month, which had produced the strongest figures in 10 years. Separate domestic data showed that wholesale trade fell by 2.8% in June from May.Canadian government bond yields edged higher across the curve. The 10-year was up 1.2 basis points at 3.764%, after touching on Tuesday its highest intraday level in nearly 15 years at 3.803%. (Reporting by Fergal Smith; Editing by Sandra Maler)

Text Content: (Adds background on lawsuit beginning in paragraph 4)By Brendan PiersonAug 16 (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court ruled on Wednesday to restrict access to the abortion pill mifepristone, partially upholding a lower court ruling that alarmed abortion advocates and pharmaceutical companies.The New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled to block changes that made the drug more accessible, but reversed a lower court ruling that suspended the drug's approval in 2000.Mifepristone's availability remains unchanged for now, following an emergency order from the U.S. Supreme Court in April preserving the status quo during the appeal.The three-judge 5th Circuit panel was reviewing an order issued in April by U.S. District Court Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk in Amarillo, Texas. While it was a preliminary ruling that applied while the case was pending, Kacsmaryk said he was ultimately likely to make it permanent.The ruling stems from a lawsuit brought by four anti-abortion groups headed by the recently formed Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine and four anti-abortion doctors who sued in November.They contend the U.S. Food and Drug Administration used an improper process when it approved mifepristone in 2000 and did not adequately consider the drug's safety when used by minors.All three judges on the panel are staunchly conservative, with a history of opposing abortion rights.The decision will almost certainly be appealed first to the full 5th Circuit and then to the U.S. Supreme Court, which last year overturned its landmark Roe v. Wade ruling that had legalized abortion nationwide.Since then, at least 15 of the 50 states have banned abortion outright while many others prohibit it after a certain length of pregnancy, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights.Mifepristone is part of a two-drug regimen with misoprostol used for medication abortions, which account for more than half of U.S. abortions. It is approved for use in the first 10 weeks of pregnancy.Story continuesNumerous medical studies and many years of real-world use have concluded that the drug is safe and effective.Major medical associations, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, have said in court filings that pulling mifepristone off the market would harm patients by forcing them to undergo more invasive surgical abortions.Hundreds of biotech and pharmaceutical company executives have called or the reversal of Kacsmaryk's ruling, saying it ignores decades of scientific evidence on the drug's safety and undermines the FDA's authority, potentially creating chaos for the industry that relies on the agency.

Text Content: A court watchdog has filed a complaint against the federal judge who ordered “religious-liberty training” for a trio of Southwest Airlines lawyers as part of their punishment for not fully following his orders in a case involving speech about abortion.The leader of Fix the Court says U.S. District Judge Brantley Starr's choice of training conducted by a Christian legal-advocacy group is “strange and unprecedented.”Fix the Court, a small, nonpartisan group known mostly for monitoring the U.S. Supreme Court, filed the judicial-misconduct petition Tuesday with the 5th Circuit Court of Appeal in New Orleans.The group's executive director, Gabe Roth, took particular aim at the Dallas judge's selection of Alliance Defending Freedom to conduct day-long training for three Southwest lawyers in a case involving a flight attendant who said she was fired for comments objecting to abortion. The conservative ADF has represented clients opposing abortion, same-sex marriages and transgender rights.Roth said ethics training would have been fine, but the judge should not have ordered training run by any organization tied to a particular faith.“Starr’s order sets a dangerous precedent, and he deserves sanctions himself for this awful judgment call,” he said.The judge ordered the training after Southwest changed the language of a notice that he ordered sent to employees to explain the legal prohibition against religious discrimination.Southwest, based in Dallas, has appealed the sanctions order and the trial victory of the fired flight attendant. A jury awarded her $5.1 million from Southwest and her union, but Starr reduced the award to about $800,000.Former President Donald Trump nominated Starr for the bench in 2019.

Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve officials at their last meeting largely remained concerned that inflation would fail to recede and suggested they may continue raising interest rates.“Most participants continued to see significant upside risks to inflation, which could require further tightening of monetary policy,” according to minutes of the US central bank’s July 25-26 policy meeting published Wednesday in Washington.“Some participants commented that even though economic activity had been resilient and the labor market had remained strong, there continued to be downside risks to economic activity and upside risks to the unemployment rate,” the Fed said.To follow Bloomberg’s TopLIVE blog, click herePolicymakers raised the target range for their benchmark rate by a quarter point at the meeting, to 5.25% to 5.5%, the highest level in 22 years. That marked a resumption of increases after they left rates unchanged at the previous gathering for the first time since early 2022.While quarterly projections last updated in June showed most officials at the time favored two more increases in 2023, Chair Jerome Powell emphasized after the July decision that the Fed would take things meeting by meeting.Restrictive Policy“We intend again to keep policy restrictive until we’re confident that inflation is coming down sustainably to our 2% target, and we’re prepared to further tighten if that is appropriate,” Powell told reporters on July 26.Following release of the minutes, Treasury yields remained higher, while the S&P 500 index extended its losses on the day and the dollar added to its gains.Public remarks from officials on the Federal Open Market Committee since the July meeting suggest the strong degree of consensus underpinning the aggressive tightening campaign of the last year and a half may be starting to fray.Story continuesSome, such as Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker, have indicated the central bank might not need to keep raising interest rates. Others, including Fed Governor Michelle Bowman, have taken the opposite view.“A number of participants judged that, with the stance of monetary policy in restrictive territory, risks to the achievement of the committee’s goals had become more two-sided, and it was important that the committee’s decisions balance the risk of an inadvertent overtightening of policy against the cost of an insufficient tightening,” the minutes stated.While the FOMC’s 11 voting members unanimously agreed to raise interest rates in July, the support wasn’t unanimous among the broader panel of about 18 officials, as two favored leaving rates unchanged or “could have supported such a proposal,” the minutes showed.Trader ExpectationsInvestors currently do not expect another rate increase this year, according to futures contracts, though the implied odds of a hike at the Oct. 31-Nov. 1 meeting are higher than those for their next meeting on Sept. 19-20.They continue to see the US central bank cutting rates in 2024, with the benchmark rate seen falling to around 4.25% by the end of next year.Fed watchers will listen for a possible signal at the Kansas City Fed’s annual Jackson Hole conference in Wyoming next week, where Powell is expected to deliver remarks.Key economic data published since the July gathering have largely supported the notion that Fed officials have some time to deliberate over the need for more tightening.Quarterly releases on employment costs and unit labor costs showed a deceleration in the pace of increases, while a measure of consumer prices excluding food and energy logged the smallest back-to-back monthly advances in more than two years.The minutes also conveyed optimism about the outlook for the US economy as the Fed’s influential staff economists “no longer judged that the economy would enter a mild recession toward the end of the year.”Still, they expected economic growth over the next two years “would run below their estimate of potential output growth, leading to a small increase in the unemployment rate relative to its current level.”--With assistance from Chris Middleton and Liz Capo McCormick.(Updates with detail on officials’ views, market reaction.)©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

Text Content: (Recasts headline and paragraph 1; adds update from FEMA administrator in paragraphs 6-7 and 10, and social media post from Maui business in paragraphs 12-13; new byline)By Jonathan AllenLAHAINA, Hawaii, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Hawaii officials on Wednesday reopened a highway into West Maui to all motorists for the first time since last week's deadly wildfire, but the devastated town of Lahaina remained closed as the painstaking search for hundreds of missing dragged on.The highway, which bypasses the "destruction zone" on the northwestern shore of the island, was previously closed to all but residents of the surrounding area, first responders and people who work in local businesses.Except for a brief relaxation earlier this week, authorities have barred entry into the zone to allow the slow process of finding and identifying victims to proceed as quickly as possible.In Washington, the White House said President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden would travel to Hawaii next week to survey the destruction, meet with first responders and survivors, and confer with officials over relief efforts."I remain committed to delivering everything the people of Hawaii need as they recover from this disaster," Biden said in a post on the social media platform X, previously known as Twitter.On Wednesday Biden approved Hawaii's request that the federal government to reimburse the full cost of 30 days of the emergency work expected to be carried out over the next four months, said Deanne Criswell, head of the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Administration, during a news briefing at the White House.Criswell, who visited Maui last week, said the community was going through an "amazingly traumatic event," and said Biden "is going to be able to bring hope" during his visit next week.The federal government so far has given out $2.3 million in assistance to families, and approved more than 1,300 registrations for assistance, Criswell said in Wednesday's briefing.Story continuesWith the number of confirmed deaths now standing at 106, dozens of canine search teams and 700 federal personnel were working with local officials in the search for more victims, FEMA said on Wednesday.The teams had covered only 27% of the disaster area as of Tuesday, Governor Josh Green said in a televised address. Some 80% to 90% of the zone is expected to have been swept by the weekend.The inferno killed at least 106 people after racing from grasslands outside town into Lahaina last Tuesday and charring a 5-square-mile (13-square-km) area of town in hours. The fire, which caught residents by surprise, destroyed 2,200 buildings and caused an estimated $5.5 billion in damage, officials said.A week later, traumatized residents have grown weary from living off relief supplies. Until Wednesday's reopening, many have been kept from inspecting their homes and still left awaiting news of their missing loved ones.The lack of access to homes and businesses has helped fuel frustrations in the community of 13,000 people. Maui Fresh Streatery, a local business, urged people in a Facebook post to refrain from using the highway into town for sightseeing."There will be plenty of time later to see the immensity and scale of this disaster," it said. "Let us allow this time for our Lahaina residents."Kiet Ma, who has worked as a taxi driver on the island for 20 years, is one of the few who has been able to return to his home to assess the damage. He and his wife Daisy are now staying indefinitely with family on the outskirts of Lahaina."So many years we put our hard work into that house. We have no chance to take anything out. No warning, no nothing. Thank God I have my husband and I still survive," Daisy Ma said.The cause of the fire is yet to be determined and it remains under investigation. The New York Times, citing interviews and video evidence, reported the brush fire that spread into Lahaina started from a broken power line.As officials work to identify the deceased, stories about those who perished have emerged from loved ones.Relatives of Kevin and Saane Tanaka said on the fundraising website GoFundMe, that the bodies of Saane's sister, 7-year-old nephew and parents were found in a burned-out car near their home."Words cannot express how devastating this is for the family," the post said, noting that the family have had no time to grieve after taking in more than a dozen other displaced relatives.(Reporting by Jorge Garcia and Sandra Stojanovic in Hawaii; additional reporting by Brendan O'Brien in Chicago; editing by Jonathan Oatis and Sandra Maler)

Text Content: (Reuters) - A Russian warship on Sunday fired warning shots at a cargo ship in the southwestern Black Sea as it made its way northwards, the first time Russia has fired on merchant shipping beyond Ukraine since exiting a landmark UN-brokered grain deal last month. Russia in July halted participation < in the Black Sea grain deal that allowed Ukraine to export agricultural produce via the Black Sea and Moscow cautioned that it deemed all ships heading to Ukrainian waters to be potentially carrying weapons. Russia said in a statement that its Vasily Bykov patrol ship had fired automatic weapons on the Palau-flagged Sukru Okan vessel after the ship's captain failed to respond to a request to halt for an inspection. Russia said the vessel was making its way towards the Ukrainian port of Izmail. Refinitiv shipping data showed the ship was currently near the coast of Bulgaria and heading towards the Romanian port of Sulina. "To forcibly stop the vessel, warning fire was opened from automatic weapons," the Russian defence ministry said. The Russian military boarded the vessel with the help of a Ka-29 helicopter, the ministry said. "After the inspection group completed its work on board, the Sukru Okan continued on its way to the port of Izmail," the defence ministry said. A Turkish defence ministry official said he had heard an incident had taken place involving a ship heading for Romania, and that Ankara was looking into it. A spokesman for Ukraine's defence ministry said officials had no details about the incident yet but that it was "clearly another hostile act" by Russia. Russia and Ukraine are two of the world's top agricultural producers, and major players in the wheat, barley, maize, rapeseed, rapeseed oil, sunflower seed and sunflower oil markets. Russia is also dominant in the fertiliser market. Since Russia left the Black Sea grain deal, both Moscow and Kyiv have issued warnings and carried out attacks that have sent jitters through global commodity, oil and shipping markets. Russia has said it will treat any ships approaching Ukrainian ports as potential military vessels, and their flag countries as combatants on the Ukrainian side. Russia also struck Ukrainian grain facilities < on the Danube. Ukraine responded with a similar threat to ships approaching Russian or Russian-held Ukrainian ports. Ukraine also attacked a Russian oil tanker and a warship at its Novorossiysk naval base, next door to a major grain and oil port. Ukraine and the West say Russia's steps amount to a de-facto blockade of Ukrainian ports that threatens to cut off the flow of wheat and sunflower seeds from Ukraine to world markets. Russia dismisses that interpretation and says the West failed to implement a parallel agreement easing rules for its own food and fertiliser exports.

Text Content: (Reuters) - The death toll from the Maui wildfires in Hawaii reached 93 on Saturday, according to the Maui County website, making it the deadliest U.S. wildfire in more than a century, with the total likely to rise as cadaver dogs sift through the ruins of Lahaina. The scale of the damage came into sharper focus four days after a fast-moving blaze leveled the historic resort town, obliterating buildings and melting cars. The cost to rebuild Lahaina was estimated at $5.5 billion, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), with more than 2,200 structures damaged or destroyed and more than 2,100 acres (850 hectares) burned. Hawaii Governor Josh Green warned at a press conference on Saturday afternoon the death toll would continue to increase as more victims were discovered. Dogs trained to detect bodies have covered only 3% of the search area, Maui County Police Chief John Pelletier said. Officials vowed to examine the state's emergency notification systems after some residents questioned whether more could have been done to warn them before the fire overtook their homes. Some were forced to wade into the Pacific Ocean to escape. Sirens stationed around the island - intended to warn of impending natural disasters - never sounded, and widespread power and cellular outages hampered other forms of alerts. The state's attorney general, Anne Lopez, said she was launching a review of the decision-making before and during the fire, while Green told CNN he had authorized a review of the emergency response. Officials have described a nightmarish confluence of factors - including communications network failures, wind gusts of up to 80 miles per hour (130 kph) from an offshore hurricane and a separate wildfire dozens of miles away - that made it nearly impossible to coordinate in real time with the emergency management agency that would typically issue warnings and evacuation orders. "Over time, we'll be able to figure out if we could have better protected people," said Green. He said the multiple fires and dangerous winds created extraordinarily difficult conditions. The death toll made the inferno, which erupted on Tuesday, Hawaii's worst natural disaster, surpassing a tsunami that killed 61 people in 1960, a year after Hawaii became a U.S. state. The latest figure exceeded the 85 people who perished in a 2018 fire in the town of Paradise, California, and was the highest toll from a wildfire since 1918, when the Cloquet fire in Minnesota and Wisconsin claimed 453 lives. Officials have secured 1,000 hotel rooms for people who lost their homes and are arranging for rental properties to serve as housing at no cost to families, Green said. More than 1,400 people had been taken in at emergency shelters. Deanne Criswell, the FEMA director, said the agency had 150 people on the ground and that additional search teams and dogs would be arriving within a day or two. RAPID ADVANCE Authorities began allowing residents back into west Maui on Friday, although the fire zone in Lahaina remained barricaded. Officials warned there could be toxic fumes from smoldering areas and said search operations were continuing. Hundreds of people were still missing, though a precise count was not clear. At a family assistance center in Kahului, June Lacuesta said he was trying to locate nine relatives who had not been heard from since Tuesday. "When I see Lahaina town itself, I cannot describe the feelings I get," said Lacuesta, who was headed to a church shelter next to continue his search. The disaster began just after midnight on Tuesday when a brush fire was reported in the town of Kula, roughly 35 miles (55 km) from Lahaina. About five hours later, power was knocked out in Lahaina. In updates posted on Facebook that morning, Maui County said a three-acre (1.2-hectare) brush fire cropped up in Lahaina around 6:30 a.m. but had been contained by 10 a.m. Subsequent updates were focused on the Kula fire, which had burned hundreds of acres and forced some local evacuations. But at around 3:30 p.m., according to the county's updates, the Lahaina fire flared up. Some residents began evacuating while people including hotel guests on the town's west side were instructed to shelter in place. In the ensuing hours, the county posted a series of evacuation orders on Facebook, though it was not clear whether residents were receiving them as people frantically fled the fast-advancing flames. Some witnesses said they had little warning, describing their terror as the blaze destroyed the town around them in what seemed to be a matter of minutes.

Text Content: SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices eased on Monday after seven straight weeks of gains supported by tightening supply on OPEC+ output cuts, as concerns about China's faltering economic recovery and a stronger dollar weighed. Brent crude futures fell 29 cents, or 0.3%, to $86.52 a barrel by 0033 GMT while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was at $82.95 a barrel, down 24 cen ts, or 0.3%. Prices slipped as the U.S. dollar index extended gains on Monday after a slightly bigger increase in U.S. producer prices in July lifted Treasury yields despite expectations that the Federal Reserve is at the end of hiking interest rates. [FR X/] Oil may be range -bound this week as China's sluggish economic recovery and a stronger U.S. dollar could depress prices, but OPEC+ would do whatever it takes to keep supply tight and stabilise markets, CMC Markets analyst Tina Teng said. Supply cuts b y Saudi Arabia and Russia, part of the alliance between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies, or OPEC+, are expected to erode oil inventories in the rest of this year, potentially driving prices even higher, the Internatio nal Energy Agency said in its monthly report on Friday. Reflecting tightening supply, the price spread between first and second month Brent held steady on Monday after settling at 67 cents on Friday, the widest since March.

Text Content: Playing the stock market no longer has the appeal for newbie investors it once did. The latest reason? Many would -be day traders  are about to start paying their student loans again. The retail -trading fir e of 2020 and 2021 has been just smoldering for months now.  Drops in crypto  and stocks in 2022 t urned off many amateur traders. High inflation left many with less cash to play with. The resulting jump in interest rates gave them lots of options for relatively risk -free ways to earn returns. Now,  student loan payments , set to restart in October, are another bucket of cold water on the fire. Emanu el Rodriguez, who is 22 and graduated this year from the University of Southern California with a communications degree, has enjoyed some success in his nascent investing foray. In 2021, he said, he cashed out a profit of about $4,500 after investing in do gecoin. But now, Rodriguez says he’s being more cautious. He’s still keeping some money in cryptocurrencies, but he deleted the  Robinhood  app from his phone and f ocuses more on saving. The  recent Supreme Court ruling , which knocked down  President Biden’s student -debt forgiveness plan, helped seal his decision. “My loans have been looming over me,” said Rodriguez, who is working as a page at NBC in Los Angeles and said he has about $5,000 in student loans. “If they were wiped, I w ould feel more comfortable investing.” He hopes to re -enter active investing someday, but only after paying off his debt and learning more about investing outside of crypto. Loan payments have been paused since March 2020, when the Covid pandemic hit the U .S. The restart could have implications across the economy.  Retailers, for one, could be hurt  as potentially billions of dollars each month start flowing back to student debt. The impact on the stock market itself might be limited. Young adults who have lost money during their short trading careers could feel particular pressure to pull back. A lot  of amateur investors have “probably been losing money to more sophisticated traders in the market over time,” said  Benjamin Edwards, a law professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. “The only way they’re able to keep trading is by continuing to put  money in. It’s going to be players who get hot at the table but Vegas still wins.” People of all ages  embraced day trading  in the depths of the pandemic, when they were stuck at home and the market mostly zoomed higher. The pause in student loan payments didn’t hurt either. Many of the younger new traders have never known a world in which tradin g can’t be done with a few clicks on an app —or, for that matter, a world where they have to pay money toward their student loans each month. A survey released this year by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and the CFA Institute found that 56% of  Gen Zers in the U.S., ages 18 to 25, had at least one investment. That included workplace -sponsored plans such as 401(k)s. The median amount invested was $4,000. Gen Z investors tend to favor cryptocurrencies and individual stocks, according to the surve y. Of course, staying in the market through both good times and bad is the best way to build long -term wealth, financial advisers say. But that doesn’t always help people who need money right away. The return of student -loan payments could mean a big hit  to many people’s monthly cash flow. The  Bank of America Institute  estimates that it will cost the median affected household about $180 a month. People who were ab le to save up during the student -loan moratorium are now going to have to spend down some of their savings, said  David Tinsley, senior economist at the Bank of America Institute. They might also have to put off saving for a home or storing up for retiremen t. “People need to start saving for retirement relatively young,” Tinsley said. “These are quite impactful decisions on individuals.”

Source: U.S. Steel Rejects Offer From Cleveland-Cliffs.pdf
Text Content: U.S. Steel  X 0.98% increase;  green  up pointing  triangle  rejected  an unsolicited offer from rival  Cleveland -Cliffs  CLF  -0.07% decrease;  red down  pointing  triang le, stopping for now a deal that would significantly reshape the domestic steel industry. Cleveland -Cliffs said on Sunday it offered U.S. Steel $17.50 a share in cash and 1.023 shares of Cliffs stock, which would value U. S. Steel at more than $7 billion. Cleveland -Cliffs said the implied value of the offer is $35 a share. U.S. Steel stock closed at $22.72 on Friday. According to Cleveland -Cliffs, U.S. Steel’s board rejected the offer, calling it “unreasonable.” U.S. Steel said Sunday that it was reviewing “strategic alternatives.” Combining Cleveland -Cliffs and U.S. Steel would reduce the major steelmakers in the U.S. to three from four. Such a deal would strengthen Cleveland -Cliffs’ position in major steel -consuming indust ries, particularly appliances and automotive, where Cliffs is already the largest supplier of steel by volume. “We expect to create a lower -cost, more innovative and stronger domestic supplier for our customers,” Cleveland -Cliffs Chief Executive  Lourenco Goncalves  said. Created in 1901 by  J.P. Morgan , Andrew Carnegie and others, U.S. Steel played an integral role in the country’s industrialization  in the 20th century, supplying steel for everything from railroads to automobiles and skyscrapers. It is no longer one of the largest American companies, but remains a major player in the steel industry. U.S. Steel, Cleveland -Cliffs,  Nucor  and Steel Dynamics  account for most of the steel produced in the U.S. But Cleveland -Cliffs and U.S. Steel are considered the high -cost producers in the pack. Most of their steel mills are older and more expensive to operate than Nucor and Steel Dynamics’ plants. U.S. Steel and Cleveland -Cliffs’ mills are also mostly staffed by members of t he United Steelworkers. U.S. Steel said Sunday it was considering offers for all or parts of the 122 - year -old company from several parties, but only identified Cleveland -Cliffs by name. U.S. Steel Chief Executive  David Burritt  said the company has “commenc ed a comprehensive and thorough review of strategic alternatives.” Goncalves said Cleveland -Cliffs submitted its offer for U.S. Steel to the company’s board on July 28. He said over the following weeks he had no further engagement with U.S. Steel until rec eiving notification by a letter Sunday that said its board had rejected the offer. He said he decided to “make our proposal public to help expedite substantive engagement between our two companies.” U.S. Steel responded by releasing the letter it sent to C leveland -Cliffs, which said U.S. Steel wouldn’t go forward with negotiations unless Cleveland -Cliffs signed a nondisclosure agreement between the two companies.  U.S. Steel said Cleveland -Cliffs refused unless U.S. Steel accepted the economic terms of Cleve land -Cliffs’ offer in advance. Cleveland -Cliffs had no immediate comment. Goncalves’ pursuit of U.S. Steel is the latest in a series of swashbuckling moves in recent years that transformed Cleveland -Cliffs from an iron -ore mining company to a major steel p roducer. Goncalves acquired struggling Ohio -based AK Steel and most of the U.S. steel mills operated by Luxembourg -based  ArcelorMittal  as steel prices slumped during  the early days of the Covid -19 pandemic. The consolidation of the steel market coincided with a  major run -up in steel prices  caused by pandemic -related shortages and supply -chain problems. By fall 2021, the spot -market price of sheet steel had reached nearly $2,000 a ton from below $500 a ton in late 2019.  Steelmakers have been adding steel mills  to take advantage of the rising prices and the protection from cheaper foreign steel  provided by tariffs on imports. U.S. Steel also has benefited from higher steel prices. Since taking over as CEO in 2017, Burritt has reversed almost a decade’s worth of losses by closing some older mills and acquiring Big River Steel in Arkansas in 2021. The Big River purchase provided U.S. Steel with a lower -cost mill that produces steel from scrap melted in electric furnaces, instead of the iron - ore-based steelmaking at U.S. Steel’s other mills. U.S. Steel plans to double Big River’s annual capacit y to 6 million tons of steel. The company is also adding a line to produce special thin steel used in electric -vehicle motors. The only other steel company in the U.S. able to produce electrical steel is Cleveland -Cliffs. Copyright ©2023  Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Source: What Wall Street’s Top Recession Gauge Is Saying Now.pdf
Text Content: Wall Street is growing confident the U.S.  can avoid a recession . But one key market indicator is still sending seemingly bleak signals. Right now, yields on longer -term U.S. Treasurys remain far below those of shorter -term bonds, an anomaly known as an inverted yield curve that has earned fame as a harbinger of downturns. That has left many investors questioning what the inversion means now. Here is a look at the possible answers: The basics A yield curve shows the annualized percentage return, or yield, that investors can get on Treasurys, from the three -month bill to the 30 -year bond, if held to maturity. Yields largely reflect investors’ expectatio ns for what short -term interest rates set by the Federal Reserve will average over the life of a bond —often plus a little extra for the risk of holding bonds for longer. Yield curve, U.S. Treasurys A warning signal Inverted y ield curves have taken on almost mythical status on Wall Street because of their recession -predicting track record. One popular measure is the gap between yields on 10 -year and 2 -year notes, known as the 2 -10 spread. Spread between two -year and 10 -year Tre asury yields, monthly Department (unemployment) Can this time be different? The simplest message sent by inverted yield curves is that investors think that short -term interest rates will be lower in the future than they are now. But that doesn’t mean that a recession is guaranteed. There have, in fact, been times when the Fed first raised, then lowered, rates and managed to skirt a recession. That might have even happened after it cut rates in 2019, if not for the pandemic. Federal Funds Effective Rates Investors and economists have become more optimistic in recent months because inflation has subsided even as unemployment has remained near a five -decade low. That is true even of the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, which strips out volatile food and energy categories: Core Personal -consumption expenditures price index, 3 -month annualized change As the Fed sees it, short -term rates, adjusted for short -term inflation expectations, are currently above a so -called neutral level and therefore working to push inflation down. Notably, bond yields and Fed forecasts both sugge st that real rates will fall gradually over years before leveling off, a sign that investors and officials don’t foresee a sharp economic downturn. Fed officials have also said that they might cut rates partly just to offset falling inflation, which would drive up real rates if they didn’t take any action. Projected read fed -funds rate What to watch for The economy doesn’t typical ly enter a recession when the yield curve is inverted. Rather, the curve uninverts shortly before a recession, with short -term bond yields falling because the Fed is cutting rates or is on the verge of doing so. Yield Curve, Treasurys Analysts call this a “bull steepening” because bond prices are rallying, causing yields to fall, while the curve is getting steeper or uninverting. Recently, though, the bond market experienced a “bear steepening,” in whic h longer -term yields rose sharply but short -term yields edged only slightly higher. Yield curve, Treasurys The curve was becoming less inverted but not in the normal way:  Investors were growing more optimistic  about the economy and scaling back bets on interest -rate cuts. Going f orward, analysts see a decent chance that the yield curve could stay inverted longer than normal, given the unusually large yield -gap and the strength of the economy. But the inversion will end eventually and how it ends will be telling —whether the main ca use is falling interest rates or new bets that the economy can withstand higher rates than previously believed.

Source: Yen Slides to Weakest Since November on Wide Japan-US Yield Gap.pdf
Text Content: (Bloomberg) -- The yen slid to its weakest level this year as a persistently wide interest -rate gap with the US weighs on the Japanese currency. Investors are now on guard for any sharp moves as traders return in Tokyo following a holiday in Japan on Friday. The currency depreciated past 145.07 and towards a zone that last year saw Japanese authorities intervene in  the market. It was at 145.18 at 9:35 a.m. Tokyo time on Monday, the weakest since November. The yen was under pressure last week, as a drop in Treasuries pushed up US yields. Benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond yields sit below 0.6%, versus more t han 4% for similar maturity Treasuries. While the BOJ adjusted its yield -curve control program on July 28 to make it more flexible — allowing 10 -year rates room to move up toward 1% — this has failed to stem weakness in the currency. That’s partly because  the central bank has also indicated it won’t tolerate a rapid move in yields, and bought JGBs to stem the climb. The central bank has repeatedly said that its adjustments to YCC are not steps toward an exit from ultra -easy monetary policy. Japan is the o nly nation that maintains a negative interest rate, which continues to weigh on the yen. The bout of pronounced weakness in the currency late last year drew Japanese authorities into the market on three occasions, in what were their first such interventio ns to support the yen since 1998. The first of the forays came as it tumbled toward 146. The yen has slumped about 9.5% against the dollar this year, making it the worst performer among key developed -market currencies. ©2023 Bloomberg L.P.
